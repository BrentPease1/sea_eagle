My life more lucky from there, one of the most interesting things is that I discovered that the stone has the shape of an Eagle, has eyes, corners of eyes, has a nose, and has a very powerful Eagle beak. My boy is 7 year olds, He can recognize all the national flags of countries in the world, including the smallest islands, He helped me more than 90% to create the Eagle Rock collection. Eagle Rock has 6 collections, each collection has its own uniqueness and unlike any other, each collection has 36 NFTs of 36 national flags from around the world.

There are estimated to be only around 5,000 individuals left, including this one, which has somehow made its way to the Taunton river in Massachusetts.
