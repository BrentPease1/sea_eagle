We had only decided to try for the bird at 8 pm the previous evening, and somehow everything worked out perfectly. Less than 15 minutes after arriving and chatting with several friendly locals searching unsuccessfully so far for the bird, I went back to the truck to get the scope and heard "there it is!" by a lovely birder Ali. As I looked up, the bird was flying approximately 400 feet up and away to the west over the restaurant, only to land in a tree in shadow. It stayed there for under a minute, they taking off across and north to another section of the harbor. It landed in a tree where I was able to take very distant digiscope shots. After several minutes atop a tall pine, it flew up harbor and out of sight.----As word got out and more and more people arrived, the bird flew suddenly around the edge of the harbor and landed, partially concealed, in a tall pine 1700 feet away (distance measured later on Google Maps). Here it stayed for about 2 hours with its back to us, occasionally turning this way and that and giving us great looks at the beak. The white tail and shoulder patch were also partially visible. ----During this period, we were lucky to be able too see the eagle at all and knowing it would eventually take off most stuck it out in the 10* weather. Sun and no wind saved us all. Some followers stated it seemed to get active around high tide that was soon approaching. As we waited, crowds at the dock (now swaying slightly) and across the harbor at the Colonial Pemaquid State Historic Site gathered to over 200, with many coming and going. All were very friendly, and stories were swapped during our wait as to where everyone lived (as far as Minnesota) and how many times individuals had seen the bird or tried for the bird. We also kept busy by checking out the rest of the avian life. ----No sooner than Sean came back from the truck to warm up then someone yelled "it's up!" It launched itself out of the tree and headed along the coast right for us, veering off over the trees and out of sight for only a moment. It then reappeared, taking the same flight path, although a little closer, over the restaurant. No one said a word as the bird cruised past us, a tangle of black and white and yellow shocking against the blue sky until it was nearly out of sight. Then the cheering irrupted into whoops, whistles, cries, and finally clapping. What an extraordinary experience!

Cold (11 degrees) and windy, but so worth it.	Many thanks to Jessica Blake for refinding the bird and posting on GroupMe. We were on the bridge between Arrowsic and Georgetown looking downriver when it flew out from a hidden cove and crossed to the other side of the river. White wing patches and large orange bill noted. Bird later flew toward the bridge and right overhead. Clear views of large eagle with dark brown head, white patches on leading edge of the wing, white rump and white wedge shaped tale, and very large orange bill. Circled at relatively low altitude above the river for a couple of minutes, affording excellent extended views. Harassed somewhat by a red-tail. Two immature bald eagles also flying in the area. Truly breathtaking views.

A pickup truck showed up while I was here.	So, I do not have any photos, but I was down here birding and I saw 2 eagles. 1 was an adult Bald Eagle that flew close enough to me on the neck to see its white head and tail. As it flew across the bay towards Hungry Island, another, larger Eagle wad seen flying from the East towards the Island. Because of the lighting it appeared all black, but it flew with large, ponderous wing beats. The Bald Eagle was still in sight, fling perpendicular to the dark eagle's flight. The dark Eagle was headed towards the Bald Eagle and I saw them both in close proximity. I was hoping the larger Eagle would turn and fly towards me, or turn enough to catch some hazy sunlight,  but it did not. It turned and disappeared over Hungry Island with the Bald Eagle. I was reluctant to post this info yesterday because I did not see the distinctive field marks, but I have seen the Steller's twice now and I have seen it fly, and this Eagle was huge. I realize I can totally be mistaken, but after checking to see that no one has seen the Eagle since the 13th, I thought I should share this. Be aware that the road to Jones Neck is a narrow, dirt road and parking is limited.The end of Jones Neck is private property and you cannot drive up there, but Jones Neck is a public kayak and canoe launch site. I know that Bald Eagle nest out on Hungry Island and are seen from this location almost every time I visit.

While I was there the bird was seen briefly as distant flybys three times, at or below the treeline. Each time it moved from one non-visible location to another non-visible location. First from the west side to the east side (I didn't personally get on it in time for this first pass), then it wasn't seen for 90 min or so, then it flew back to the west side and seemingly perched out of view, spooking two bald eagles (I had good clear scope views of it this time). Then about an hour later it flew back towards the north east (had clear views of it again), but lost it trying to get my camera on it. Unfortunately never managed to get a photo, but it was bigger than the nearby bald eagles with a large orange/yellow bill and crisp white costal wing patches. Unmistakable

The bird climbed and flew out of view.
