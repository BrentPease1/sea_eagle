I was ready for this moment, having been up late helping to vet the reports from Sunday and helping to plan for this inevitability of the bird's rediscovery--I knew the four Eckerson brothers, who bird this stretch of river more than anyone and know every nook, cranny, and viewpoint, would refind this bird if it was available to be refound.----I briefly considered whether this was a drop everything, throw home life into turmoil, and jump in the car scenario or whether I should start packing bags, making breakfast, cleaning up after my dog (gross!), packing cold-weather-gear for my four-year-old, and laying the groundwork for a long day to enjoy the eagle while remaining in good graces at home. Despite my disastrous decisions on Bristol County's other bird twitch of 2021 (the Heermann's Gull), I opted for the smart play here and got out the door a bit slower but with the full support of the team at home. I rolled straight into Mallard Point, where the eagle had been sitting in a tall White Pine on the horizon no less than 1.4 mi distant to the NE. It was so distant that when I peeked in Jeremiah's scope upon arrival, it took me 8-10 sec to spot the bird, even though it was silhouetted in one of the pines on the horizon! Even in those views, it was distinctive though, showing broad white shoulders, a dark head, a white tail, and a huge, yellow bill. It was perhaps even farther than my views in South Korea though!----As Min's patience waned, and Min started to wear on the patience of the birders, we departed back to the car for a snack and a reassessment. The bird was not getting any closer...and if it did, the dozens of watchers would alert us. We opted to try to find a better vantage. It took 20 minutes to drive around and when I did, I ended up on the wrong side of the Taunton River still, checking from Bayview Ave. instead of the Stop n' Shop Distribution Center, where it was actually perched. Recalibrating with JRT, I started heading for the SnS zone, even though he had yet to find a vantage that improved significantly on the views from Mallard Point. As I was en route though, texts started popping that it flew north, and I immediately redirected towards Assonet Bay...my best decision of the day. ----I went straight to the area of the Cliff Ave. private beach on Wescott Island (which residents gave permission to use today and in the off season). I arrived and had a good view of the bay and began systematically checking the trees on the far side and scanning the air for flying eagles. By this point, I had spoken with Andy Eckerson who told me the bird had flown low directly up the river towards Assonet Bay, so I felt I was in the right area. But a couple minutes of searching revealed nothing. I knew JRT had been watching it too, so called him as I continued to cruise and scan the trees. He had less of a sense for where it had gone than Andy Eckerson, but just 20-30 sec into speaking to him he said "I see it" and then I heard him fire 10-15 photos. I was freaking out. I had a sense that he was looking towards me, but our views were different. He checked a mpa. Told me where. It was perched on the left edge of Shoves Neck--exactly where I had been scanning. What was wrong with me? Could he have his nearings wrong? Could I? We compared landmarks, although I did not know where he was and he didn't know where I was. I referenced the marsh with red cedars on the left side...but he couldn't see that. His description made no sense to me. I waffled back and forth and we finally sent pins and map screengrabs back and forth. He clarified where it was, I calmed down and did a more careful scan looking through the trees instead of just in the openings, and spotted it quickly right where he had said all along: on the left edge of Shoves Neck, perched high but not too high. Boom. Scope. Amazing. Steller's point blank (almost...Google says 621m or 2038 ft) in Mass. Min stayed in the car for a bit while I enjoyed this bird totally by myself. At one moment I stopped. It was calling. I was getting out of car and heard the yelping call coming from direction of perched eagle and did not recognize it (but did not think it sounded even a little bit like the wimpy Bald Eagle call), but immediately deduced that it was no bird sound that I knew, and was loud, and therefore must be the Steller's. I started recording just in time and looked through the scope just in time to hear it call again--and see it call again as it opened its beak in time with the sound--just as an immature Bald Eagle flew right to left in the field of view. More than any other moment today (which was incredible) this one will live in my memory. A *calling* Steller's Sea-Eagle in Mass.----I reveled in that for a minute or so, and then started stressing about getting others there. Made a few calls, sent a few pins, and then J&J (&J) rolled up. We had amazing scope looks together for another ten minutes, in near silence (though Min became ever more rambunctious, understandably). The eagle called a few more times. I mostly failed to get more recordings. We had a few holy sh&* moments of just reveling in this bird in this place. I chatted to a local landowner to prepare him for the coming onslaught of birder vehicles. And then it arrived. Cars started rolling in. Liam Waters got it, thankfully, since I heard he had just missed it flying off its perch. Others followed fast on its heels. Min was out and scampering as cars rolled in too fast (understandably, but still). It started calling again. We all tried to record it, as more people started chattering. Justin Lawson rolled in and chatted instead of parking while I was trying to record. A vanload with Connecticut Audubon emblazoned on the side rolled in. The bird dropped lower in the tree and was less visible. People were parking on both sides, nearly blocking the street. I got out of there and went to the private beach, where it was again quiet, the bird was easily scopable if a few meters more distant, and Min and Juniper could run out their energy. Then I looked and the huge yellow bill was missing. Had it flown? Yes...flying dead away. I got it in the scope and called it out to J as it passed over the treeline and dropped away. Flying away it was truly massive and showed the broad white shoulders impressively.  It seemed to be headed straight to Shaws Boat Yard/Dighton Rock SP. More people rolled up and came down to us, only to have us say it had just flown and that they should check the other side of the river. Eventually the crowds heeded and relocated, but many only did so when word came that the bird had been actually relocated. No idea why twitchers rarely go look and just wait to go twitch. But so it was.----We piled back in: J&J and I were the first to arrive and last to leave. Another birder asked to follow me. No problem. I left Min's balance bike (thankfully recovered: thanks JPE!). Off to Dighton Creek SP, where there were 80 cars and counting, with new cars arriving every minute for the next 90. Insanity. Perfect viewing. Birding bliss for all who arrived except for those that arrived too late (sorry TBJ). Many referred to it as an amazing reunion for all regional New England birders: hard to imagine a better occasion for this.	***mega; pure insanity. I am no fan of emojis in eBird comments, but the only words here are &#x1f92f;----Epic day: if you had told me yesterday that I'd be getting audio recordings of Steller's Sea-Eagle vocalizing in Dighton, Mass, I am not sure I ever could have believed it...even though many of us have joked about the Maritimes Steller's making its way south to *our* patch, you never really expect it to actually be 40 minutes from *your* house! Especially gratifying day because my fears about an issue with residents, or police, or something else seemed largely unfounded, especially once the bird was found across the river from Dighton Creek SP, with ample parking for many dozens of cars and giving everyone (and their grandmother) the opportunity to observe the bird safely through scopes, which gave excellent looks at a safe distance, with no need to encroach upon the bird for closer looks or regret how distant these looks were. Better than I could have dreamed!----This adult Steller's does seem individually identifiable, from its pattern of white in the coverts and even primaries. There are not lots of flight shots from today, and more legwork is probably required to firmly establish the same bird theory. But on probability (no evidence for more than one adult Steller's outside of Alaska over the past two years) and early checks of feather details on flight shots, this bird seems to check out as the same as seen in Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia in June-Nov 2021 and Denali Highway in 2020 (Texas in Mar 2021 also presumed same bird, but maybe not probably so). Watch for more analysis of this bird's movements.----Also worth saying: if raptor vagrancy was not embraced in prior decades, perhaps it can be now. Multiple individual raptors have now turned up far from home range and through individually identifiable plumage features, or tags/bands, have been confirmed to be the same birds moving massive distances (e.g., South Padre Island--&gt;Portland Maine for Great Black-Hawk, Zone-tailed from Nova Scotia to Virginia and almost every state/province in between, tagged California Condors roaming to Wyoming, Bearded Vultures wandering all of Europe including the UK, etc.). Raptors seem to just go on walkabout sometimes: it’s in their nature. Ongoing patterns of terrestrial vagrancy in raptors shows great capability of exploratory wandering, so northerly Short-tailed Hawks, Crested Caracaras, and even wayward Gray Hawks and Zone-taileds, are now seemingly routine as these birds get photographed more and correctly identified more. And large raptors can cover a lot of ground. What's next? Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture or White Hawk in the US? Confidence that Red-backed Hawk records are legit? Anyway, count me as a believer that a Steller's that decides to wander, can wander, especially once it makes landfall in mainland western Alaska.----For chasers on 21 Dec, we wish you the best. This bird's departure to the north was a bit unnerving: it could have left the area. On the plus side, it could have done an exploration and will return to its favorite haunts that it has worked for the past week. Photos from 12 Dec and 17 Dec seemed to be exactly at Dighton Rock SP...or nearby. So maybe it really likes the area, as do a dozen+ Bald Eagles. FYI, not a single serious birder knew about this bird before 19 Dec. The birding community jumped on it with vigor and not a single birder was secretive or unethical in how news spread thereafter. On the other hand, the initial news only broke because word leaked out gradually from the Massachusetts Department of Fish & Game. That leak was intentionally slow: the intention from the state agency was to *not* share this bird...and this was apparently partly because of past bad photographer (and birder?) behavior and reputation as other birds, like Snowy and Long-eared Owls. Warranted? Or not? You be the judge.----But once this reached the birding world, a number of people went above and beyond to veri

Refound early today and staked out several times before reported again from Dighton Rock SP. Seen (with permission from staff) from Shaw's Boat Yard with MOb. Perched in a tree with juvenile Bald Eagles for over an hour. Around 1.10 pm, it flew a little upriver, began soaring and was eventually harassed by a raven and flew away straight in NNW direction.----Huge raptor, dwarfing nearby Bald Eagle. Blackish-brown overall, with white rump and wedge-shaped tail, white shoulder bars, huge, orange-yellow bill, yellow eyes, orange-yellow legs, white pants.

Apparently photographed 8(?) days prior at Shaw Cove Boat Yard by David Ennis. However, more than one resident along the river stated to having seen the bird for consistently for the past couple weeks at least. One in Assonet Bay has had the bird perching in a large oak in their yard frequently while another living just north of Dighton Rock SP said they had seen it perching out on a dead tree in the water for the past week. ----With only the info that it had last been seen Friday the 17th at Shaw Cove Boat Yard, my brothers and I came up with a game plan for the morning. Matt and Joel covered SCBY up to Broad Cove at sunrise while I stood watch at Mallard Point. At 6:50AM the bird appeared at 10 o'clock of Mallard Point on the far side of the river flying down river. Flew a short distance before landing on the far side, not passing 11 o'clock of Mallard Point. Snagged a couple photos before calling several people and getting the word out. Shortly after Matt and Joel showed up the bird flew down and snagged a fish before returning to its perch. However, shortly after it was chased up river by two Bald Eagles and landed back from the river up in a large white pine stand. It continued here for close to an hour and 30 minutes before taking off again and heading northeast towards Assonet Bay. Sure enough, shortly after Marshall Iliff refound it in Assonet Bay in another stand of white pines, directly across from this viewing point 41.799289,-71.091491. It was viewed here for maybe 40 minutes (calling!!) before it again took off, this time heading to Shaw Cove Boat Yard where Matt and Joel while viewing from Dighton Rock State Park refound it almost instantly. Bird proceeded to chill here for the next several hours before being flushed by someone. Flew north and was viewed circling distantly for some time over the power station before finally disappearing. ----Best bet for tomorrow is probably viewing from Mallard Point before sunrise looking for it to leave roost.

Only its head and neck were visible. We heard the eagle calling (sometimes raspy, muted 'kek' calls reminiscent of a gull) before we even saw it! At ~11:08am the eagle took off and flew straight WNW and was then quickly re-found over near Shaw's Boat Yard in the West Branch of the Taunton River.----When perched the eagle's massively thick and orangey-yellow bill was the most obvious feature. In a scope you could make out details on the head such as the eagle's large pale eye set on a black face, with wispy tawny plumes down the eagle's crown and nape. In flight, the distinctive wing shape and wedge-shaped, white tail were clearly seen in addition to the overall blackish coloration and long white patagial patches.----A photographer named David Ennis discovered this Steller's Sea-Eagle near Shaw's Boat Yard in the West Branch of the Taunton River on Dec 12th. He isn't a birder, so news was slow to spread to the birding community but the photos were verified and the location was nailed down yesterday, Dec 19th. The Eckersons were on the scene early this morning and quickly discovered the bird at 6:45am along the river a little S of the Dighton Rock State Park. The eagle was tracked around the area all morning before it settled into a pine at Shoves Neck (described above).----This is presumably the same adult Steller's Sea-Eagle roaming widely across North America over the last year; first seen in central AK, then southern TX, then around eastern Canada, and has now pushed south into MA. These two articles do a job summarizing the bird's travels and the theory behind all these sightings pertaining to the same bird:----https://www.birdguides.com/news/stellers-sea-eagle-tracked-across-north-america/?fbclid=IwAR38ctwWfBThOOoLtFX5jJgY_gXKBR6cv4ftWxz6J58qY6Ws4KWGk0hcLUI----https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/stellers-sea-eagle-dazzles-birders-on-lone-odyssey-180979035/

Paid little attention other more routine species.	First reported in this area this morning but apparently present for several days before being positively identified.  Presumably the same individual seen in QC, NB, and NS.  See https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/science/stellers-sea-eagle.html. This bird was perched with an imm. BAEA across the Taunton River from Dighton Pt SP. when we arrived, Many, many birders (50+) on site.  ----This was an enormous  Haliaetus eagle, fully a third larger than the nearby imm BAEA.  Huge yellow-orange bill, dark, almost black body with big pure white shoulders down to leading edge of inner wing (secondary coverrts), lower back, tail, undertail coverts and "leggings."  In flight, leading edge of wing was prominently white. I noticed that the flight shape and wing flap were distinctively different from BAEA, less "plank-like."  Tail white and wedge-shaped.----Bird was perched when we arrived near BAEA. After 10 +/- minutes, it defecated and I expected immediate lift-off.  But it settled back in for a minute or two and then both BAEA and STSE lifted off  at 12:58, the BAEA only a fraction of a second sooner.  They split up and the STSE flew in tight circles, gaining altitude steadily and soon began being harassed by a Common Raven.  It then headed directly away from us (= to north) still being harassed by raven  until we lost sight of it in the scope.

About time this bird worked its way to New England! Scoped across the Taunton River with hundreds of birders from across the northeast after running back and forth across the area all morning trying to locate this glorious fellow. Massive eagle, dwarfing the bald eagles with which it was perched. Adult; dark eagle with white wings and tail, humongous yellow bill. Did not fly while I was watching, unfortunately. Digiscoped photos. ----As of right now this individual is believed to be the same adult that has been wandering the Maritimes since August, which I had long hoped would accompany the bald eagles south into New England. If so, this bird has made an incredible odyssey, second only to the unfortunate Maine Great Black Hawk among rare birds I've seen. Has apparently been present in the area since at least 12/12/2021, so chances of it lingering seem good.----Hopefully this bird will make a habit of perching across from Dighton Rock SP; not many lookouts on this river that have both publicly accessibility and high capacity parking.

This individual is no doubt the same bird that had been seen in Alaska in 2020, and then possibly in Texas in 3/21.  Then it showed up in Quebec, NB, and Nova Scotia from late June through November.  Word came out on 12/19 that the bird had been photographed in this same area along the Taunton River (and in same tree possibly at Dighton Rock SP!?) on 12/12.  Someone re-found it early on 12/20 and Jane noticed the post to CTBirds while we were enjoying coffee in bed.  So she played hooky from work and we tore down there.  After just barely missing it at a couple of spots we finally caught up with it at Dighton Rocks SP.  It hung out in these trees for a couple of hours and over 200 people got to see it.  Sadly, it appears that a photographer may have flushed it (at about 1:10 PM) as scores of birders were still en route.----Other birders present that saw the bird at Dighton Rock SP that I said hi to included at least: S. Wrisley, S. Bennett, E. Norton, H. Bauer, J. Mullen, J. Sparrell & K. Towler, S, Harvell, J. Lambert, J. Trimble, I. Davies, M. Illiff, L. Ferraresso, B. Stymeist, A. Lamoreaux, H. Willoughby, K.

Offerman, L. Grimes, and many others.----Birders that arrived too late included B.& D. Fox, R. & M. Suomala, G.& J. Gove.----As of the date of me writing this....12/13 at 9:00 AM....the bird has not (yet) been relocated.

Originally found in this area on December 12, 2021, then re-found this morning by Jonathan Eckerson. ----Perched directly across the river below a Bald Eagle. Eventually took flight around 12:55 pm, flew behind the trees, came back and circled for roughly 5-10 minutes. Interestingly, it was chased out of the area by a single Common Raven harassing it. The eagle was not relocated the rest of the day despite considerable effort.  ----Large raptor, mostly dark brown, white tail, with a large and striking orange bill, as well as wing coverts creating an equally striking bright white patch on each wing. Underwings had less white, giving it a different visual feel when it circled away vs. toward an observer.

The bird was apparently photographed in the general area back on 12/12 and relocated this AM (after birders became aware of the 12/12 sighting and went looking for it).----The bird was originally found this AM further south and could be seen from the Somerset Boat Launch. At around 10am it flew north. It was briefly seen from Cliff Drive in Asonett MA (not by myself). It then flew north to Dighton Rock State Park where it spent over 2 hours perched in a tree across the river giving excellent looks.

Slowly soared higher and distantly circled while a raven escorted it out of sight over the tree line on the west side of the river.----Much better views from this location but it is private property. It is my understanding that permission was granted for birders to go out onto the docks to view the bird, but you have to check with the boat yard employees/owners before proceeding. They were very enthusiastic when I was there, waving birders in. This could easily become overwhelming over time though with the great number of people that have chased (and will chase) this bird for as long as it continues.

Quite a few bald eagles, but nothing bigger than that. Eventually got word that the sea-eagle was being seen from Dighton Rock SP at a location on our side of the river not far from us. So we headed to the boatyard, parked outside, and walked in after getting permission from the gracious owners. An array of people were lined up along the perimeter of the yard over the water, where the Steller’s Sea Eagle was posing for incredible looks. A watchful immature bald eagle was perched above it, comparatively diminutive. We stayed until it eventually took off, and watched as it flew north-ish, getting mobbed by a crow/raven.	Photos.

Only its head and neck were visible. We heard the eagle calling (sometimes raspy, muted 'kek' calls reminiscent of a gull) before we even saw it! At ~11:08am the eagle took off and flew straight WNW and was then quickly re-found over near Shaw's Boat Yard in the West Branch of the Taunton River. ----When perched the eagle's massively thick and orangey-yellow bill was the most obvious feature. In a scope you could make out details on the head such as the eagle's large pale eye set on a black face, with wispy tawny plumes down the eagle's crown and nape. In flight, the distinctive wing shape and wedge-shaped, white tail were clearly seen in addition to the overall blackish coloration and long white patagial patches. ----A photographer named David Ennis discovered this Steller's Sea-Eagle near Shaw's Boat Yard in the West Branch of the Taunton River on Dec 12th. He isn't a birder, so news was slow to spread to the birding community but the photos were verified and the location was nailed down yesterday, Dec 19th. The Eckersons were on the scene early this morning and quickly discovered the bird at 6:45am along the river a little S of the Dighton Rock State Park. The eagle was tracked around the area all morning before it settled into a pine at Shoves Neck (described above).----This is presumably the same adult Steller's Sea-Eagle roaming widely across North America over the last year; first seen in central AK, then southern TX, then around eastern Canada, and has now pushed south into MA. These two articles do a job summarizing the bird's travels and the theory behind all these sightings pertaining to the same bird: ----https://www.birdguides.com/news/stellers-sea-eagle-tracked-across-north-america/?fbclid=IwAR38ctwWfBThOOoLtFX5jJgY_gXKBR6cv4ftWxz6J58qY6Ws4KWGk0hcLUI----https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/stellers-sea-eagle-dazzles-birders-on-lone-odyssey-180979035/----Article on the Mass sighting: https://www.masslive.com/boston/2021/12/rare-sighting-of-the-stellers-sea-eagle-has-been-spotted-in-massachusetts-for-the-first-time.html?fbclid=IwAR1nox9OlTNub7HoNo83n3U05kf3lcRZ2jvrPdeOM4hfaEEg3ULM3QvSajA

Apparently photographed 8(?) days prior at Shaw Cove Boat Yard by David Ennis. However, more than one resident along the river stated to having seen the bird for consistently for the past couple weeks at least. One in Assonet Bay has had the bird perching in a large oak in their yard frequently while another living just north of Dighton Rock SP said they had seen it perching out on a dead tree in the water for the past week. ----With only the info that it had last been seen Friday the 17th at Shaw Cove Boat Yard, my brothers and I came up with a game plan for the morning. Matt and Joel covered SCBY up to Broad Cove at sunrise while I stood watch at Mallard Point. At 6:50AM the bird appeared at 10 o'clock of Mallard Point on the far side of the river flying down river. Flew a short distance before landing on the far side, not passing 11 o'clock of Mallard Point. Snagged a couple photos before calling several people and getting the word out. Shortly after Matt and Joel showed up the bird flew down and snagged a fish before returning to its perch. However, shortly after it was chased up river by two Bald Eagles and landed back from the river up in a large white pine stand. It continued here for close to an hour and 30 minutes before taking off again and heading northeast towards Assonet Bay. Sure enough, shortly after Marshall Iliff refound it in Assonet Bay in another stand of white pines, directly across from this viewing point 41.799289,-71.091491. It was viewed here for maybe 40 minutes (calling!!) before it again took off, this time heading to Shaw Cove Boat Yard where Matt and Joel while viewing from Dighton Rock State Park refound it almost instantly. Bird proceeded to chill here for the next several hours before being flushed by someone. Flew north and was viewed circling distantly for some time over the power station before finally disappearing. ----Best bet for tomorrow is probably viewing from Mallard Point before sunrise looking for it to leave roost.

Bird proceeded to chill here for the next several hours before being flushed by someone. Flew north and was viewed circling distantly for some time over the power station before finally disappearing. ----Best bet for tomorrow is probably viewing from Mallard Point before sunrise looking for it to leave roost.

Fingers are crossed for the people still looking for the Steller's Sea Eagle.   ***revised my report to reflect the correct time of birding after realizing my camera is ahead one hour.	Thanks to Brian Cassie for getting the word out and to Jonathan Eckerson who refound the bird this morning, and to ALL the people that kept everyone in the loop and helped us see this bird.  Magnificent eagle!  Dark brown, pointy white tail, white outer shoulders and onto wings, and massive beak.  Larger than Bald Eagles sitting next to it on the tree.  Originally seen from Dighton Rock SP.  After about 15 minutes we decided to go to the other side of the river for a better view.  We drove to the boatyard and went immediately to an employee and asked permission to come in to observe the eagle on their property.  They were very nice and invited us in.  (we would not have entered if we did not have permission)  We had amazing looks at the eagle from that spot.  I still can't believe we saw a Steller's Sea Eagle!

White coloration extending about halfway up the flanks. Giant, glaring, bright-yellow bill. Otherwise all dark apart from the bright white areas of the forewings. More limited white forewing on the underside than on top. Incredibly striking bird, and hard to mistake for anything else in this plumage!----After getting out of a doctor's appointment I made a b-line for Dighton Rock State Park, hoping to arrive in time to see this bird. When I was about 15 minutes away, I got a text from Skyler Kardell suggesting I come to the other side of the river where they were having better views. I quickly changed the GPS and it didn't change our time much if at all. Then, when I was 4 minutes away (1:01PM), he texted that the bird had flown. I became extremely nervous that it wouldn't be visible when I arrived, but before I was able to acknowledge the idea that I might miss this bird, I saw <a href="https://ebird.org/checklist/S99187865">Will Sweet, Liam Waters, and Amy O'Neill</a> pulled over in a parking lot, all pointing optics to the sky. We quickly pulled into the lot and I ran over to them, immediately seeing the Steller's Sea-Eagle circling high above the road in good sunlight! We celebrated a bit and watched the bird circling for ~5 minutes before it flew off to the North. Just before it disappeared behind the treeline a Common Raven began harassing it. I didn't see the eagle disappear because I'd briefly ran back over to the car, and when I returned it was no longer visible. I called Skyler to inform him that I'd gotten to see the bird and what direction it was flying in. Even though I only saw the bird at a distance for 5 minutes, this was one of the most incredible birds I've chased!----There have been <a href="https://ebird.org/map/stseag?neg=true&env.minX=-137.90145495788295&env.minY=25.271196285689786&env.maxX=-33.83895495788295&env.maxY=59.280852110830864&zh=true&gp=false&ev=Z&mr=1-12&bmo=1&emo=12&yr=range&byr=2021&eyr=2021">several reports of an adult(s) throughout Northeastern Canada this year</a> during the summer, and then again in November. It seems possible/likely that these all account for the same individual but this still remains uncertain as far as I know.----I see no reason to suggest captive provenance for this individual. They have a known history of turning up as vagrants in Alaska especially. "Vagrants recorded up to 3000 km from regular range on Kure and Midway (Hawaiian Is), and wandering birds recorded as far afield as Anadyr, Yakutsk, Beijing and various parts of SW Alaska (seven records, some of them involving long-staying individuals, mostly Pribilofs and Aleutians)."

Had just flown over and perched here after being seen perched in a pine at the SW corner of Shoves Neck, and viewed from Cliff Drive on Bryants Neck in the East Branch of the Taunton River.----Immediately upon arriving at the state park, we were shown by other birders already present that the eagle was perched among 4 Bald Eagles across the river, and just N of Shaw's Boat Yard. Throughout the time we observed it, the eagles perched nearby and soaring around the general area all slowly drifted off to the NW which then left the Steller's with a single immature Bald for quite awhile until they too flushed at 12:59pm and headed off to the NW. When the Steller's took flight it lazily soared NW-ward for a moment but quickly attracted a Common Raven which relentlessly hounded the eagle and chased it straight away from us heading NW. After the raven had successfully chased the eagle far, far away from us it broke off the eagle, the made at least 6 triumphant barrel-rolls in the air!----A few times the eagle was heard calling (sometimes raspy, muted 'kek' calls reminiscent of a gull). When perched the eagle's massively thick and orangey-yellow bill was the most obvious feature. In a scope you could make out details on the head such as the eagle's large pale eye set on a black face, with wispy tawny plumes down the eagle's crown and nape. A small white spot is present on the eagle's forehead. A thin orange-yellow orbital ridge can be seen above the eagle's eye. In flight, the distinctive wing shape and wedge-shaped, white tail were clearly seen in addition to the overall blackish coloration and long white patagial patches.----A photographer named David Ennis discovered this Steller's Sea-Eagle near Shaw's Boat Yard in the West Branch of the Taunton River on Dec 12th. He isn't a birder, so news was slow to spread to the birding community but the photos were verified and the location was nailed down yesterday, Dec 19th. The Eckersons were on the scene early this morning and quickly discovered the bird at 6:45am along the river a little S of the Dighton Rock State Park.----This is presumably the same adult Steller's Sea-Eagle roaming widely across North America over the last year; first seen in central AK, then southern TX, then around eastern Canada, and has now pushed south into MA. These two articles do a job summarizing the bird's travels and the theory behind all these sightings pertaining to the same bird:----https://www.birdguides.com/news/stellers-sea-eagle-tracked-across-north-america/?fbclid=IwAR38ctwWfBThOOoLtFX5jJgY_gXKBR6cv4ftWxz6J58qY6Ws4KWGk0hcLUI----https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/stellers-sea-eagle-dazzles-birders-on-lone-odyssey-180979035/

After just under twenty minutes (we arrived just in time!) it was chased off by a Common Raven and headed north, rapidly gaining altitude. A second raven joined the fray and the two CORA were utterly dwarfed by the Sea-Eagle. A number of us followed the latter in our scopes until it was eventually lost when it was at least several kilometers upriver. Spectacular record of a bird that has traversed the entirety of North America, both latitudinally and longitudinally. Refound in coastal Maine ten days later. Poor digiscoped photos and a flew flight shots obtained. First state record for Massachusetts.

Yesterday (12/19) a report surfaced of a STSE in Dighton, MA back on the 12th - apparently the observer was not sure of what they had seen, and the photos took several days to be confirmed. Incredibly the bird was refound this morning (12/20) in the same area, and word spread quickly throughout New England. I followed the bird's progress while driving up, and arrived at Shaw's boat dock just after hearing that the STSE was being seen across the river from Dighton SP. We confirmed with employees of the dock that it would be alright to head to the pier to check for the eagle, and were able to spot it in a tree with two immature BAEA. The STSE remained perched in the tree for an hour after we first spotted it, and seemed very relaxed (preening, sunning, and scanning the area for prey) despite the ever-growing throngs of birders on both sides of the river. At about 1:15PM the STSE took off, heading slightly north to where the Taunton River narrows, and began soaring, before being harassed by a raven and heading west over land, where we lost sight of it. ----To say this bird was unmistakable would be an understatement: nearly double the size of the nearby BAEA, with a clearly wedge-shaped white tail, prominent white patches on the shoulders, and most notably an absolutely colossal, bright yellow bill, like one of those prehistoric Terror Birds, which was visible with the naked eye from over 100 meters. In flight the strongly wedged tail was clearly visible, as well as the huge, broad, paddle-shaped wings, accentuated by the clean white extending up to the rear flanks from the tail & rump. This is a species I've dreamed of seeing since first looking through my old Nat Geo guide, and it did not disappoint. What an absolute behemoth!----The consensus at this time seems to be that this STSE is likely the same individual that was seen sporadically throughout the summer in northern New Brunswick and the Gaspé Peninsula, QC, which was apparently confirmed as the same individual seen in summer of 2020 in interior Alaska, supporting a wild origin from far eastern Russia. A sighting on the 3rd and 4th of November in central Nova Scotia is also thought to be this individual, and this sighting would support a southward trajectory through the late fall into winter consistent with the same individual's appearance in MA. Whether this bird is the same individual seen in AK/QC/NB/NS, or the very enigmatic TX bird remains to be seen, but I (and I'm sure many others) will be keen to learn more about this incredible bird's history - and its next destination!----Any birders checking this location in the future should be aware that this dock is private property, and permission MUST be granted from the employees before using the docks to search the riverbanks. They are aware of the situation regarding the eagle, but regardless please check before entering!

Apparently photographed 8(?) days prior at Shaw Cove Boat Yard by David Ennis. However, more than one resident along the river stated to having seen the bird for consistently for the past couple weeks at least. One in Assonet Bay has had the bird perching in a large oak in their yard frequently while another living just north of Dighton Rock SP said they had seen it perching out on a dead tree in the water for the past week. ----With only the info that it had last been seen Friday the 17th at Shaw Cove Boat Yard, my brothers and I came up with a game plan for the morning. Matt and Joel covered SCBY up to Broad Cove at sunrise while I stood watch at Mallard Point. At 6:50AM the bird appeared at 10 o'clock of Mallard Point on the far side of the river flying down river. Flew a short distance before landing on the far side, not passing 11 o'clock of Mallard Point. Snagged a couple photos before calling several people and getting the word out. Shortly after Matt and Joel showed up the bird flew down and snagged a fish before returning to its perch. However, shortly after it was chased up river by two Bald Eagles and landed back from the river up in a large white pine stand. It continued here for close to an hour and 30 minutes before taking off again and heading northeast towards Assonet Bay. Sure enough, shortly after Marshall Iliff refound it in Assonet Bay in another stand of white pines, directly across from this viewing point 41.799289,-71.091491. It was viewed here for maybe 40 minutes (calling!!) before it again took off, this time heading to Shaw Cove Boat Yard where Matt and Joel while viewing from Dighton Rock State Park refound it almost instantly. Bird proceeded to chill here for the next several hours before being flushed by someone. Flew north and was viewed circling distantly for some time over the power station before finally disappearing. ----Best bet for tomorrow is probably viewing from Mallard Point before sunrise looking for it to leave roost.

I woke up to texts about the bird which was amazingly REFOUND early this morning by the Eckerson's. Many thanks to them and tons of other birders for tracking it up and down the river. As I arrived at Somerset Boat Launch, the bird had just flown upriver. After an agonizing 30 minutes, we got word that it had been relocated at Cliff Ave in Assonet. Just as I was showing up there it was reported that the bird had flown off again.----Thankfully the bird was refound again, this time viewed from Dighton Rock State Park. The bird remained perched in a tree on the west side of the river for nearly two hours as the mob of birders at least tripled in size. After viewing it for about an hour I decided to run to the over side of the river and try to get closer views from Shaw's Boat Yard. Additional details (and better(?) photos) on that checklist.----HUGE raptor, making the Bald Eagles it was with look small. Brown body, white tail, white leading edge of wings, huge honking yellow bill.----Provenance is uncertain, but the AK/TX/Canada sightings might all be of the same bird? I don't even care if this bird isn't considered wild - it was absolutely unbelievable to see in real life no matter what!

Apparently photographed 8(?) days prior at Shaw Cove Boat Yard by David Ennis. However, more than one resident along the river stated to having seen the bird for consistently for the past couple weeks at least. One in Assonet Bay has had the bird perching in a large oak in their yard frequently while another living just north of Dighton Rock SP said they had seen it perching out on a dead tree in the water for the past week. ----With only the info that it had last been seen Friday the 17th at Shaw Cove Boat Yard, my brothers and I came up with a game plan for the morning. Matt and Joel covered SCBY up to Broad Cove at sunrise while I stood watch at Mallard Point. At 6:50AM the bird appeared at 10 o'clock of Mallard Point on the far side of the river flying down river. Flew a short distance before landing on the far side, not passing 11 o'clock of Mallard Point. Snagged a couple photos before calling several people and getting the word out. Shortly after Matt and Joel showed up the bird flew down and snagged a fish before returning to its perch. However, shortly after it was chased up river by two Bald Eagles and landed back from the river up in a large white pine stand. It continued here for close to an hour and 30 minutes before taking off again and heading northeast towards Assonet Bay. Sure enough, shortly after Marshall Iliff refound it in Assonet Bay in another stand of white pines, directly across from this viewing point 41.799289,-71.091491. It was viewed here for maybe 40 minutes (calling!!) before it again took off, this time heading to Shaw Cove Boat Yard where Matt and Joel while viewing from Dighton Rock State Park refound it almost instantly. Bird proceeded to chill here for the next several hours before being flushed by someone. Flew north and was viewed circling distantly for some time over the power station before finally disappearing. ----Best bet for tomorrow is probably viewing from Mallard Point before sunrise looking for it to leave roost.

Had just flown over and perched here after being seen perched in a pine at the SW corner of Shoves Neck, and viewed from Cliff Drive on Bryants Neck in the East Branch of the Taunton River. ----Immediately upon arriving at the state park, we were shown by other birders already present that the eagle was perched among 4 Bald Eagles across the river, and just N of Shaw's Boat Yard. Throughout the time we observed it, the eagles perched nearby and soaring around the general area all slowly drifted off to the NW which then left the Steller's with a single immature Bald for quite awhile until they too flushed at 12:59pm and headed off to the NW. When the Steller's took flight it lazily soared NW-ward for a moment but quickly attracted a Common Raven which relentlessly hounded the eagle and chased it straight away from us heading NW. After the raven had successfully chased the eagle far, far away from us it broke off the eagle, the made at least 6 triumphant barrel-rolls in the air!----A few times the eagle was heard calling (sometimes raspy, muted 'kek' calls reminiscent of a gull). When perched the eagle's massively thick and orangey-yellow bill was the most obvious feature. In a scope you could make out details on the head such as the eagle's large pale eye set on a black face, with wispy tawny plumes down the eagle's crown and nape. A small white spot is present on the eagle's forehead. A thin orange-yellow orbital ridge can be seen above the eagle's eye. In flight, the distinctive wing shape and wedge-shaped, white tail were clearly seen in addition to the overall blackish coloration and long white patagial patches. ----A photographer named David Ennis discovered this Steller's Sea-Eagle near Shaw's Boat Yard in the West Branch of the Taunton River on Dec 12th. He isn't a birder, so news was slow to spread to the birding community but the photos were verified and the location was nailed down yesterday, Dec 19th. The Eckersons were on the scene early this morning and quickly discovered the bird at 6:45am along the river a little S of the Dighton Rock State Park.----This is presumably the same adult Steller's Sea-Eagle roaming widely across North America over the last year; first seen in central AK, then southern TX, then around eastern Canada, and has now pushed south into MA. These two articles do a job summarizing the bird's travels and the theory behind all these sightings pertaining to the same bird: ----https://www.birdguides.com/news/stellers-sea-eagle-tracked-across-north-america/?fbclid=IwAR38ctwWfBThOOoLtFX5jJgY_gXKBR6cv4ftWxz6J58qY6Ws4KWGk0hcLUI----https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/stellers-sea-eagle-dazzles-birders-on-lone-odyssey-180979035/----Article on the Mass sighting: https://www.masslive.com/boston/2021/12/rare-sighting-of-the-stellers-sea-eagle-has-been-spotted-in-massachusetts-for-the-first-time.html?fbclid=IwAR1nox9OlTNub7HoNo83n3U05kf3lcRZ2jvrPdeOM4hfaEEg3ULM3QvSajA

The bird was apparently photographed in the general area back on 12/12 and relocated this AM (after birders became aware of the 12/12 sighting and went looking for it).  ----When I arrived the bird was perched near the top of a pine far to the north. The white tail, white shoulder markings and huge orange bill could be seen. ----At around 10am it flew north. It was briefly seen from Cliff Drive in Asonett MA (not by myself). It then flew north to Dighton Rock State Park where it spent over 2 hours perched in a tree giving excellent looks.

Paid little attention other more routine species.	First reported in this area this morning but apparently present for several days before being positively identified.  Presumably the same individual seen in QC, NB, and NS.  See https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/science/stellers-sea-eagle.html. This bird was perched with an imm. BAEA across the Taunton River from Dighton Pt SP. when we arrived, Many, many birders (50+) on site.  ----This was an enormous  Haliaetus eagle, fully a third larger than the nearby imm BAEA.  Huge yellow-orange bill, dark, almost black body with big pure white shoulders down to leading edge of inner wing (secondary coverrts), lower back, tail, undertail coverts and "leggings."  In flight, leading edge of wing was prominently white. I noticed that the flight shape and wing flap were distinctively different from BAEA, less "plank-like."  Tail white and wedge-shaped.----Bird was perched when we arrived near BAEA. After 10 +/- minutes, it defecated and I expected immediate lift-off.  But it settled back in for a minute or two and then both BAEA and STSE lifted off  at 12:58, the BAEA only a fraction of a second sooner.  They split up and the STSE flew in tight circles, gaining altitude steadily and soon began being harassed by a Common Raven.  It then headed directly away from us (= to north) still being harassed by raven  until we lost sight of it in the scope.

(The bird apparently was photographed from Basin Point Road, Harpswell, on 3 January in the interim.) Today, we watched the bird perched on the southeast tip of Indiantown Island north of Moffat Cove from 07:20 until it flew off its perch at 09:55. The eagle flew southeast down Townsend Gut out of sight. Later in the morning while we sat in the parking lot at the Maine State Aquarium, we saw the bird fly over that site at 10:35. It headed southeast over the bay and landed on the west side of Spruce Point.

Huge black eagle, with prominent white leading edge of wings, and giant yellow bill clearly visible. Continuing bird, hanging around Maine since December 30. Last week it was in Boothbay Harbor.  Wasn't seen for several days, then showed in Bristol area yesterday.  Such an exciting chase!  *edit: last reported January 24, 2022 in Boothbay Harbor; glad we saw it when we did!

What an incredible bird and an incredible experience! Sooo cold though. Had to take lots of breaks to warm up in the car.	Continuing MEGA MEGA!!! Wow such an incredible bird!!!!!!!! Started morning search at Oak Point Farm a few minuets past 7am near where the bird had been last sighted the night before. Didn't find any eagles there but after spending about 15 minuets there another birder, Karen, arrived and we continued the search. At about 7:30 am Karen received coordinates of a location where the STSE had been sighted, right across from the Boothbay Harbor Post Office. We were about a 4 minuet drive from there so we immediately headed to that location. When I arrived at the Post Office there were already many birders present but still a few parking spaces left in the parking lot. As soon as I got out of my vehicle I spotted the STSE perched in a pine at the edge of the frozen inlet. Massive dark brown eagle with white wedge shaped tail, white shoulder patches, almost comically large bright yellow bill, and yellow feet. I observed the bird from about 7:30am until 11:41am when it finally took flight. Thank you to everyone for sharing all the helpful information that made it possible to see this bird! It was Brutally cold, about 0ºF at 7am "warming up" to about 11º F for a high, also about 20mph winds made it feel even colder!!! Had to take multiple breaks in the car to warm up or thaw out! But so worth it! Waited until bird flew off at around 11:41am. Lifer!

Clear (visibility 10 miles); calm; -2º F. Snow cover: the ground is mostly bare, except for scattered patches of ice.--Despite not having seen the sea eagle fly north up Townsend Gut yesterday evening, we still suspected that it was roosting somewhere to the north, and so decided it was worth a check at dawn. And indeed it was! This morning there were many more observers than yesterday morning, although still perhaps only a dozen or so, and some of these were not quick enough to spot the sea eagle. In hindsight, we have to wonder if yesterday it hadn't flown up the Gut earlier than expected - perhaps even at noon? - which would account for the lack of sightings all afternoon, and the fact that we had missed it here at dusk last night.--Sunday. Civil twilight begins 06:37, sunrise 07:08; sunset 16:28, civil twilight ends 16:59. Eastern Standard Time.--Mammals: none observed.	continuing mega rarity. we were alerted when someone watching from the east end of the bridge called out at ca 07:05 that it was coming,. we snapped to attention, and had a terrific - if all too brief - view as it flew south, fairly low down, over the bridge and farther down the Gut. great views upstream from the bridge, when it was in better light; south of the bridge it was more backlit, and so became more of a silhouette. photographed by Jay, Shawn, and no doubt others.

The adrenalin was rushing when I pulled into the aquarium parking lot. As per expected, no sightings yet. Oh well, time to find it! While scoping the area and scanning the top of every tree, a message came in through one of the many information channels. “Being seen now, Moffat Cove”. Instantly everyone rushed to this cove, about 10 minutes away from the aquarium. Upon arrival no one had eyes on it. A scramble ensued, where had it gone? A false report? ----No. Around 9:05 word got out that the bird was being seen from Ocean Gate Resort. Ted jumped in my car and we drove straight there. Following the flow of birders we found ourselves on the porch of a closed summer cabin, and quickly got the scope on the bird. Wow. A gorgeous, huge eagle with a brown body, white wing, and cartoonishly yellow beak.----I will never forget that first look. As Ted says, “Bird of a lifetime”.

Chilly morning but winds nil. Seas calm.	The bird sought by everyone present was perching atop a conifer conveniently close to Linekin Rd; viewing distance 100 yards? Time ~ 20 mins? Great scoping, albeit through heads, shoulders and deciduous branches. Supersized yellow bill prominent; yellow eye also visible. Before taking wing, the eagle leaned forward, stretched and extended both wings first in a hunch and then a stretch outward, showing off its large wing patches and keeled tail; then pooped. The crowd watched the bird take flight westward towards Mouse Island. Beautiful in flight silhouette as well, wing-tips curving strongly upward on the downbeats.

The Steller’s shortly launched from its perch to about a quarter of a mile out in Linekin Bay, and then turned south chasing a bird in flight and disappeared to the south at least well into south Linekin Bay.

A sizable crowd assembled to enjoy the show, including birders from near and far as well as plenty of curious locals. The aerial dogfight between the sea-eagle, a pair of ravens, and a Bald Eagle was truly a spectacle to behold. Well worth the trip! Clear blue skies and bright sun, still cold with light winds	Second encounter of the day with this incredible wandering individual, initial sighting details included in this checklist: https://ebird.org/checklist/S100400825 . After watching the eagle fly east across Boothbay Harbor from its perch on Juniper Point, we drove back to the Maine State Aquarium in the hopes of getting better views. The bird was soon refound perched high in a pine on the far shoreline, mostly obscured by the tree’s branches. The bold white wing markings and heavy golden beak helped pick it out at this distance. Eventually a pair of ravens began harassing it, appearing as small as crows in comparison to the hulking raptor. The eagle soon took off, initially flying west towards us but subsequently turning to head north along the treeline with the corvids in hot pursuit. A Bald Eagle soon joined the circling mob scene, allowing for another amazing direct size comparison with the Steller’s, who appeared a third as big again. Eventually the sea-eagle broke off from its pursuers and continued north, disappearing behind the trees. As far as I know, there were no confirmed reports for the rest of the day

This is a list for the west end of Factory Cove Road where the Steller's Sea-Eagle was perched. Focus on eagle and not an attempt to record all species present. At first, 5 people, but by the end of the hour 50 or more people arrived and some left. It was fun to see and talk to Charles Duncan and Laura Blutstein here. It was overcast, mid 30s F, light breeze, tide nearing low.	Perched atop a tall white pine behind a house at the western end of Factory Cove Road. The eagle preened, defecated, and was dived on by American Crows. An adult Herring Gull circled the area giving alarm yelps repeatedly.

Clear (visibility 10 miles); calm; 0º F. Snow cover: the ground is mostly bare, except for scattered patches of ice.--Word went out on the rare bird alert that the sea eagle was perched on Pooler Road, so we raced to figure out where in the heck Pooler Road was, and then how to get there. Of course, everyone one of the many eagle hunters in the area had the same inclination, so the road quickly became jammed with cars and birders. We pulled into the first quasi-close parking spot that we found, and then, following the crowd, rushed down the road to the site.--Sunday. Civil twilight begins 06:37, sunrise 07:08; sunset 16:28, civil twilight ends 16:59. Eastern Standard Time.--Mammals: none observed.	continuing mega rarity. perched in a pine at the end of Pooler Road. flew off shortly after we arrived, and almost immediately was lost from view. all of us had some kind of a view of it, although Jay, who got here first, probably saw more of it than Shawn or I did. for my part, my eye glasses were quite fogged from rushing along, and I didn't have the presence of mind to take them off in time: my only view of the eagle was through the fogged-over glasses, just as it took flight and then disappeared from sight. not a great end to my sea eagle experience, but given all that had come before, I had nothing to complain about.

Dark cloudy; FAC; 30F to 36F (balmy).  Arrived Pkg Lot DMR Lab at 10:25 AM.  Sat in truck. Cry went up at 10:34 (based on my time stamp) "he's flying over the parking lot".  Jumped out w/ camera and started firing away as it flew overhead and headed for the Eastern Shore of the harbor.  After arrival, bird perched on tippy-top of White Pine (long needles vis in digi-scoped photos) and sat immobile for more than an hour , occasionally turning its head, one preening bout for 2 min.  Mobbed by 2 Ravens , and later by 2, then 1 Am Crow.  Overhead flight photos NG (SLR) but digiscopes w/ new point & shoot (Olympus) better than expected.  (No adapter, just fingers.)  Bird still sitting in same perch at 11:51 when I left for Southport General Store for lunch.  Offered my scope to few folks to try phone-scope photos.	Large (? nothing for scale ?) Buteo-Eagle shaped raptor observed overhead and flying away, with outsized, white, wedge-shaped tail.  Body and wings all black with narrow white leading edges of wings (inner, bleeding onto outer limb).  Glimpse of yellow on bill (not well seen).  Crossed harbor and perched (see comments).  Sat on same perch for an hour plus:  All black mass, with very prominent yellow bill, although a forehead angle was apparent (unlike flight photos showing a continuous crown/top of bill ridgeline).  Right side of bird showed a very prominent white stripe on leading edge of folded wing, resembling a "lambda" shape, or inverted "V".   The corresponding white stripe on the bird's left side was only occasionally visible, and then showed itself as a very small mark.  Only reference for over-all size came with 2 ravens dive-mobbing it.  A comparison with Bald Eagle would have been more informative.  Year-Bird.  This bird rules the harbor.  See comments for photo notes.

The bird then angled towards the aquarium before continuing out behind a small island in the bay.  The Eagle then flew around the bay before ending up perched behind the aquarium.  After a short drive over to the aquarium the bird was visible only for a minute or so before it took off again.  After this I drove back to Southport where the Eagle returned to Townsends Gut.  ~45 minutes later it flew and perched off Juniper Point for a few minutes before disappearing for a while.  Upon leaving, at roughly 2 o'clock, the Eagle flew up Townsends Gut and over the bridge as I drove out.

(The bird apparently was photographed from Basin Point Road, Harpswell, on 3 January in the interim.) Today, we watched the bird perched on the southeast tip of Indiantown Island north of Moffat Cove from 07:20 until it flew off its perch at 09:55. The eagle flew southeast down Townsend Gut out of sight. Later in the morning while we sat in the parking lot at the Maine State Aquarium, we saw the bird fly over that site at 10:35. It headed southeast over the bay and landed on the west side of Spruce Point.

This was certainly one. It was -3 F when I arrived at the Maine State Aquarium around 0930, there were a few other birders there. Beaufort scale F6, constant sea smoke. STSE was seen perched in a large tree behind the condos complex across the harbor. Another birder came back from the Boothbay Harbor Yacht Club and reported the view of STSE  was far better, so I migrated. Crossed the road from BHYC to a small parking lot/storage lot to view STSE, which was perched in a large pine across the river. I wasn't more than 50 yards from this bird. It remained perched in the tree, looking around, just doing eagle stuff. Didn't seemed bothered by the large crowd at all. Gorgeous dark brown feathers, bright/huge goldenrod beak (wouldn't want to be the fish on the other end of that!), and occasionally flashed its white shoulders. Looked to be about the sized of my lower leg. Gorgeous bird. Wish I could have stayed longer to observe behavior, but wind chill of -28 F made it difficult/dangerous.

Note, however, that satellite tracking of winter range for juvenile Steller's Sea Eagles suggest that they may have 1 - 3 sub-areas that they hunt (most only have one area). The size of these areas were 274 square km for the first, 529 square km for the second, and 1,181 square km for the third (McGrady MJ. Ibis 2003, 145, 318–328)  Thus, this bird is currently likely being seen in a very small area of what could be its "wintering area."  Based on the data from immature birds, the bird's winter range could extend another 5-10 miles east and/or west from Boothbay Harbor.  ----For those looking, I think the best spot is to start early (6:45am) at Townsend Gut.  Then, to scope either from the aquarium or the end of Rock Road near the aquarium (park at the aquarium and walk down). The Rock Road spot allows you to scan the entire southern bay and Mouse Island (where it has appeared the several afternoons before it goes to roost in Townsend Gut).  Obviously, you should subscribe to get alerts via the GroupMe chat for the Steller's Sea Eagle chase group.

Fourth time’s the charm—had my lucky swallow earrings which i think did it. Put on a show flying around the whole harbor from its original perch on Spruce Pt, landed on a pine visible from the aquarium wharf. Mega-sized MEGA the most notable field mark! Seemed perfectly at ease coasting into the bitter snowy southwest wind while the gulls struggled around it; the smoothness of its flight and the stark white of the lesser coverts and retrices made it appear almost more kite than bird, especially on a glide when the arrow-shaped tail was apparent. Local long-tails scurried off as it banked in, and it seemed to be eying the less nervous mergs as it perched for the next half hour. Memorable views from there of the huge cartoonish orange bill, chicken-splayed powerful yellow talons, and even the keen yellow eye. Buffeted by occasional gusts but weathered them with little more than a ruffling of feathers; at one point bent to half-heartedly preen its breast feathers. Still roosting when I left, in numerous scope views.

It was perched near the top of a tall tree about 0.75 mile away from us, north of Pemaquid Seafood's dock on the point directly opposite of Fossetts Cove. It stayed perched there for a long time, so we moved to Pemaquid Seafood's dock to be closer.  From this location, it was about 0.3-0.4 mile away (still within same eBird location/same hotspot).  After another long while, it left this perch, and to everyone's surprise (about 50 people were at same location), it flew along the shoreline directly toward us, and passed by us giving an epic fly-by flight view!

After the bird flew overhead at the aquarium (see list https://ebird.org/pa/checklist/S100876866) Mike & I went in the direction it had flown to try to locate it. We stopped at Bristol Lobster Sales but the vantage point was not good to the south. So we drove further to the next road that went out to the west which was Factory Cove Road. Towards the end of that road there was a car pulled over and as we pulled up to it we saw the eagle sitting in the top of the pine tree we had seen it land in when we were at the aquarium. I put the location out on the GroupMe thread and gradually many more people arrived to view this bird which sat here for more than an hour. I stopped this list well before the bird left which was about 12:45 PM. I was happy to see that everyone was very respectful of private property and careful not to do anything to flush the bird.

BOOTHBAY HARBOR AREA DAY 3:  After not finding the sea-eagle on the 9th and 10th a late morning report came out that the Steller’s was seen prior to 9:00 this morning in the Birch Road area on the eastern shore of the Sprucewold/Spruce Point peninsula southeast of Boothbay Harbor.  Many chasers then quickly made it over to Barrett Park to try to spot the bird from the park.--- - ---I met a local resident there who was very familiar with the Birch Road neighborhood, and who volunteered to lead us to look for the bird there and then (unbeknownst to us ahead of time) eventually to a nearby private property vantage point off of Birch Road.  Amazingly (and unbeknownst to him ahead of time), upon arriving we immediately observed the sea-eagle preening for about 10 minutes almost heavily obscured in a large evergreen tree above the shoreline there!--- - ---The Steller’s shortly launched from its perch, flying east over the water, and continued to about a quarter of a mile out over Linekin Bay, then it turned south powerfully chasing a large bird in flight and quickly disappeared to the south around the headland continuing at least well into south Linekin Bay.  We tried to relocate the Steller’s in the Spruce Point area but could not. --- - ---The sea-eagle had been extremely elusive for almost everyone searching for the bird the two days prior.  DSLR photos and handheld phonescoped video footage were obtained (through a bit of shimmer) by these two extremely happy sea-eagle chasers from very far away!--- - -   - - -   - - ---- - -   - - -   - - ---1/19 2022 UPDATE AND AMAZING TWIST TO THE SAGA:--On the 18th, 3 days after arriving safely back in Georgia from Maine, I was browsing through YouTube footage of Steller’s Sea-Eagles and came upon this:--https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SaHowv-RJK4--- - ---A CAPTIVE STELLER’S SEA-EAGLE NAMED KODIAK (OR KODY), FROM THE NATIONAL AVIARY IN PITTSBURGH PENNSYLVANIA, HAD ESCAPED ON SEPTEMBER 25TH AND WAS AT LARGE!!!!--- - ---FAIRLY HORRIFIED, I WONDERED IF HUNDREDS OR MAYBE EVEN THOUSANDS OF BIRDERS (ME INCLUDED) WERE ALL MERELY CHASING AN ESCAPED STELLER’S SEA-EAGLE IN NEW ENGLAND???!!!--- - ---After much further searching I discovered, with immense relief, that Kodiak had remained in Pittsburgh and was retrieved there by aviary staff on October 3rd, 2021:--https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=axGiFepPd18--Here is the National Aviary’s page concerning the recovery of Kodiak on October 3rd, 2021:--https://www.aviary.org/birds-habitats/kodiak-the-stellers-sea-eagle/--- - ---BUT, I still needed to know if Kody was in captivity when I had seen the supposedly wild bird in Maine, just for my peace of mind, so I contacted the National Aviary and submitted a request for a Kody status check!--- - ---Concerning Kodiak’s whereabouts since being recovered in October the National Aviary responded on 1/19 2022 as follows:----Hi Mark,--Yes, indeed, our bird is securely in our care, and has been all winter.

After landing in a tree briefly, it took off again heading back east and landed on top of an evergreen tree on what seemed to be private property about a few hundred yards east of the fort. After sticking around for about 15 more minutes, it left heading up the mouth of the harbor northeast of the fort. A fantastic sighting and lifer.

Still cannot believe this dream has come true!! Target bird since I was 7 years old when I first opened a Peterson, I said I want to see that one!  Presumed adult Female (gender the presumption not the age and it’s based upon the much larger size of bird to local Bald eagles).                                                           We, SS and my brother arrived at the spot noted in the GROUPME only to hear dreaded “here a min ago” BUT after 20 min of sheer angst and frustration it reappeared in a Pine across the inlet on private property. Great scope views were had as it perched for over a hour and half! Stayed full duration until it finally flew off up the inlet to the adulation of over 500 (estimated) observers. The sigh of amazement was audible and simultaneously given as the bird flew! It was like being at a concert of a legendary performer doing their curtain call. This amazing bird lived up to all of the expectations and more! Truly a top birding memory with multitude of happy observers!!!

It was overcast, mid 30s F, light breeze, tide nearing low.	Perched atop a tall white pine behind a house at the western end of Factory Cove Road. The eagle preened, defecated, and was dived on by American Crows. An adult Herring Gull circled the area giving alarm yelps repeatedly.

Stationary watch at both Ft Wiliam Henry and Pemaquid Seafood Dock (private).	Yes!!  After searching unsuccessfully all morning (5 hours), the STSE was finally spotted just before noon and we came back to Ft William Henry to see it. It was perched near the top of a tall tree about 0.75 mile away from us, north of Pemaquid Seafood's dock on the point directly opposite of Fossetts Cove. It stayed perched there for a long time, so we moved to Pemaquid Seafood's dock to be closer.  From this location, it was about 0.3-0.4 mile away (still within same eBird location/same hotspot).  After another long while, it left this perch, and to everyone's surprise (about 50 people were at same location), it flew along the shoreline directly toward us, and passed by us giving an epic fly-by flight view! Unbelievably lucky, this was one of the most amazing bird sights I've ever seen!

Large hulking black mass in the top of a conifer on Juniper Point.  We were about 1000 feet to the southwest on a rocky point on Souhtport Island.  I saw its back and its profile.  White wing patches and massive yellow/orange bill were easy to see with the sun shining on it.  White tail also visible.  Conditions were good--sun shining and almost no wind.

Of course, everyone one of the many eagle hunters in the area had the same inclination, so the road quickly became jammed with cars and birders.

Reasoning that we’d have the best odds of spotting it looking north, we went searching for a public vantage point and found Pine Cliff Road. Our instincts turned out to be spot on, and we quickly found the bird on its prominent perch. Several other birders who had the same idea were gathered a little further up the road, leading to much rejoicing and several lovely reunions. Sunny and bright, but still quite breezy and chilly	Incredible record, long awaited chase opportunity after watching the saga develop for months. Finally tracked down after a sunrise sighting of the bird flying south reported from the boat launch between West Boothbay Harbor and Southport. Perched in a tall pine on Juniper Point, scoped looking north from Pine Cliff Road. Massive and imposing raptor, dark brown overall with brilliant white shoulder patches and tail. The immense golden bill was a striking field mark even at a distance. Constantly scanning the harbor, intensity of its glare was palpable whenever it looked our way. A goodly number of birders were able to observe it from this site until a group of observers approached on foot, walking through the intertidal zone right up to the base of its tree. At this point, it took off and headed across Boothbay Harbor, low over the water, coming to roost on the far eastern shore. We subsequently headed back over to the Maine State Aquarium to try our luck from that vantage point, details included in this checklist: https://ebird.org/checklist/S100401072

In brainstorming with the bois, it was determined we should divide our two teams near Thompson’s Gut to keep an eye out for the STSE as it leaves its morning roost. We opted for the Southpoint Bridge while RG and ZM posted up at Juniper Point. Using the recommendations from the Google Doc (posted below,) we arrived just before sunrise to be ready for the bird activity. The STSE was seen by ZM as it flew past him and toward us at 7:06am, where we saw it head NE and over the tree line and down to where it posed for crowds for a few hours: https://ebird.org/checklist/S100760506.

In flight, observed prominent white shoulders.  White area of forehead was observed. Orangish yellow feet. Large yellow/orangish bill and cere. White tail with white extending to flank area. Wedge appearance of tail evident. Primaries distinct, large and somewhat separated during flight  No antagonistic behavior observed during flight, but through personal communication with other observers, there was evidence of possible hunting of Canada Goose. In flight STSE came in over harbor from east (Fossetts Cove) flying at low altitude (approximately 15 feet above pier and dock associated with the Contented Sole building on north shore of Colonial Pemaquid State Historic Site;  43.879966, -69.521561) and proceeded west to tree and perched.  During perch, feathers around supraorbital ridge and head were fluffed. Head not extended but relaxed and neck feathers extended exhibiting warming behavior and actions.  Belly and flank feathers were extended over feet.  Individual appeared to be in relaxed mode and not agitated.  Some preening occurred before extension of body feathers.  STSE would periodically scan area below and outward from perch. Approximately at 16:14 STSE extended neck and was scanning area below perch, then at 16:21 STSE left perch and flew eastward, gathered elevation and turned back to west and flew over Thurston Point.  Anecdotally presumed to fly back toward the Boothbay Harbor area that it was seen previously.  STSE adult seemed to be in good health, non-agitated behavior, although prior to leaving perch seemed to be alerted to disturbance or possible prey.  American Crows were seen to mob the STSE adult while in the area before observed at perch (personal communication with other observers), and this possibly was the reason for movement outside of other perch sites in the area, although as stated earlier, some possible predation attempts were performed before my observations.

Stationary watch at both Ft Wiliam Henry and Pemaquid Seafood Dock (private).	Yes!!  After searching unsuccessfully all morning (5 hours), the STSE was finally spotted around noon and we arived back at Ft William Henry.  It was perched about 0.75 mile away from us, north of Pemaquid Seafood's dock on the point directly opposite of Fossetts Cove. It stayed perched there for a long time, and then we moved to Pemaquid Seafood's dock, about 0.3-0.4 mile away from the perch (within same eBird location/same hotspot).  After another long while it left this perch, and to everyone's surprise (about 50 people were at same location), it flew along the shoreline directly toward us, and passed by us giving an epic fly-by flight view!  Unbelievably lucky, this was one of the most amazing bird sights I've ever seen!

Clear (visibility 10 miles); wind variable at 7 mph to NW at 10 mph, gusting to 22 mph; 1-7º F. Snow cover: the ground is mostly bare, except for scattered patches of ice. West Harbor Pond is completely frozen over, but the water below the bridge in Boothbay Harbor remains open.--We raced over to the Boothbay Harbor Yacht Club, stopped in their parking lot, and raced west across the road, where the sea eagle was quite obvious. A large crowd quickly assembled; unexpectedly, but not really surprisingly, Ann Mitchell was there too. For the first few minutes we were content to view from the initial location, but, realizing that a side view might be better (even if slightly more distant), we slipped down to the bridge across the mouth of West Harbor Pond. Only a few other observers were there when we arrived, but many others later joined us, some parking on the side of the road, or even on the bridge. Not surprisingly, this became an issue in short order, and after a couple of hours a few police arrived to try to keep both cars and observers in line. (It ws impressive to see, though, how quickly the crowds cleared after the eagle left.) We really wanted to see the bird in flight, but it persisted in giving us absolutely crippling views of it perched, for hour after hour; so periodically we'd take our chances and go sit in the car for a while to warm up, before heading back out for another stint for forced sea eagle viewing.--Note that this site is just north of the aquarium, across the harbor. We gather that Ross Gallardy and his party had a quick sighting of this bird early in the morning (from the Southport Swing Bridge?), which they did not post, but which sent them on a quest for the eagle. And after a thankfully short search, scanning all close coves and inlets, they came across the bird here. Congrats, and many thanks!--Saturday. Civil twilight begins 06:37, sunrise 07:09; sunset 16:26, civil twilight ends 16:58. Eastern Standard Time.--Mammals: none observed.	continuing mega rarity. extraordinarily cooperative, almost too much so. when we screamed into the parking lot here and got out of the car, it was perched in full sun in a tall pine on the west side of West Harbor Pond, across from the yacht club, and not 100 yards away. the massive eagle was facing us, which allowed for great view of the overall bulk, the massive orangey yellow bill, the beady yellow iris, the details of the shaggy brown head and breast plumage, and the white, graduated tail; but could see only a small piece of the white shoulders (and of only one shoulder to boot). after a while, then, we drifted down to the bridge below, where we could view it from more of an angle, and get a somewhat better appreciation of it. the eagle was quite aware of its surroundings, looking around constantly, but otherwise not doing much: it was big news if it do much as pulled one foot up and tucked it into the plumage. every hour or so it would act as if it might fly: pooping and wiggling the tail; or leaning forward and raising the tail (again pooping?), in each case leading to speculation that it was about to fly. and we all wanted it to fly, we wanted to see the majesty of those broad white shoulders and get a better sense of the overall heft of the bird. despite the apparent flight intention actions, and despite that fact that we were slowly dying in the brutal cold, however, the eagle stubbornly would not take flight. rarely if ever have I waited so long or suffered so much to see a rare bird in flight. after almost four hours, it finally did something dramatic, and turned around on its perch. this presented a possibility that we had not even counted upon: that it might take flight, but instead of flying right past or even over us, it might fly directly away. and that's about what it did: it soon took flight, heading away, and would have been lost behind the trees had it not angled off to the north and up a bit, so we had a decent view of it flight, albeit trending in the wrong direction. just at the end, it turned west again, and we lost it behind trees. as best that we can determine, it was not seen again for the rest of the day. many photos by Jay, Shawn (but none calendar worthy?), and many others.

Still cannot believe this dream has come true!! Target bird since I was 7 years old when I first opened a Peterson, I said I want to see that one!  Presumed adult Female (gender the presumption not the age and it’s based upon the much larger size of bird to local Bald eagles).                                                           We, SS and my brother arrived at the spot noted in the GROUPME only to hear dreaded “here a min ago” BUT after 20 min of sheer angst and frustration it reappeared in a Pine across the inlet on private property. Great scope views were had as it perched for over a hour and half! Stayed full duration until it finally flew off up the inlet to the adulation of over 500 (estimated) observers. The sigh of amazement was audible and simultaneously given as the bird flew! It was like being at a concert of a legendary performer doing their curtain call. This amazing bird lived up to all of the expectations and more! Truly a top birding memory with multitude of happy observers!!!

Excited that we got the chance to see it, even from a distance. Weather was cold (maybe 10F by the time we arrived) but thankfully not windy like the day before. Clear skies. Counted 8 RT Hawks on our drive up :)	Continuing mega rarity. We arrived after the bird had flown from Spruce Point to Mouse Island. It was perched halfway up a spruce tree just south of an adult Bald Eagle which was much more visible. Very difficult to find the bird without instructions from folks already on it. The STSE was facing away from the water (and us) but the white patches on its wings were clear (could even be seen with 10x42 binocs), and through the scope, beak was occasionally discernible when the eagle turned left or right. Impressive sight, even a mile away. Heat shimmer made it difficult to get a digiscope worth posting. Fun to be a part of the enraptured throngs and share our scope with passersby.

Dropped behind trees toward end of peninsula raising several ducks. Drove around to peninsula and could not relocate but lack of access to shoreline and light rain made it searching and viewing difficult.  Large eagle flying at slight angle away above treetops and against gray sky. White pointed tail with more extensive white on rear than Bald Eagles. Dark head. Extensive white on rear more obvious when it dropped into or behind trees. At angle flying slightly away, distance, and mist could not discern white wing patches on leading edge of wings before it dropped into or behind trees. More white on rear than Bald and dark head. I had been watching during the morning at least two adult Balds  that were working the shoreline and point of the peninsula.

Massive eagle with white shoulders, white tail, yellow-orange legs, massive yellow-orange bill. Gorgeous structure, with long, gently curved neck in flight. Bushy, widely spread tail in flight. First seen perched across the bay from Fort William Henry, mostly occluded, in a tall conifer. It eventually took off and flew north, landing in a large spruce. Next, it flew around the bay and disappeared in Fossetts Cove, where birders reported being able to see it from Pemaquid Seafood. After some time, it reappeared, taking off north up the channel, before returning in dramatic fashion to alight once again across from the fort. Finally, it briefly flew north over the treeline before flying southwest across the peninsula, towards South Bristol. Photos forthcoming.

Unfortunately, around 9:10 AM, multiple photographers/ birders approached the eagle closely on foot, directly flushing it (as has happened repeatedly with this individual bird); the sea-eagle flew far to the east, landing again in a tall white pine near Factory Cove, well over a mile away from our position. We shifted over to the Maine State Aquarium but could see the bird only partially in the distance, so we returned to Pine Cliff Rd. again. From this spot, we watched the Steller’s Sea-Eagle soaring high over the eastern side of the harbor with two Common Ravens and a Bald Eagle.

Clear (visibility 10 miles); calm; -2º F. Snow cover: the ground is mostly bare, except for scattered patches of ice.--Despite not having seen the sea eagle fly north up Townsend Gut yesterday evening, we still suspected that it was roosting somewhere to the north, and so decided it was worth a check at dawn. And indeed it was! This morning there were many more observers than yesterday morning, although still perhaps only a dozen or so, and some of these were not quick enough to spot the sea eagle. In hindsight, we have to wonder if yesterday it hadn't flown up the Gut earlier than expected - perhaps even at noon? - which would account for the lack of sightings all afternoon, and the fact that we had missed it here at dusk last night.--Sunday. Civil twilight begins 06:37, sunrise 07:08; sunset 16:28, civil twilight ends 16:59. Eastern Standard Time.--Mammals: none observed.	continuing mega rarity. while my attention was focused on trying to relocate the female Hooded Merganser that we had seen here yesterday evening, we were alerted to the arrival of the sea eagle when someone watching from the east end of the bridge called out at ca 07:05 that it was coming. we snapped to attention, and had a terrific - if all too brief - view as it flew south, fairly low down, over the bridge and farther down the Gut. great views upstream from the bridge, when it was in better light; south of the bridge it was more backlit, and so became more of a silhouette. photographed by Jay, Shawn, and no doubt others.

I was delighted to run into Doug Gochfeld, Michael and Louise, and Tom Johnson.	Third time's a charm!  I arrived at Colonial Pemaquid State Historic Site about 3pm and found that the bird had just been seen flying and then landed on a dock, I believe. I missed it. About 10 min later I was talking to a friend then walked over to a group of folks only to find that it just flew again and went left around the corner and further up the cove out of sight. I missed it again. Many people left. I stayed. About 20 min later I saw it come back around the corner from up the cove. I yelled to get the few remaining people on the bird. It then flew straight at us with the sun behind us and perfect lighting. Flying low it kept coming and flew passed us to the left. I snapped photos constantly as it approach, then my battery died! DIED! Darn! But I had a few shots that I hoped were good enough. The Eagle then landed across the cove and we set our scopes up and got all the newcomers on the bird before it flew again. It stayed for maybe 30 min, then pooped, stretched upward, and flew off along the tree tops to the right, then 180 turn and back to the left and over the trees and disappeared. What an amazing afternoon. In the crowd were folks from Maine, Texas, Oklahoma, Indiana, Alabama, New Jersey, New York, and I bet several more distant places.

First seen perched across the bay from Fort William Henry, mostly occluded, in a tall conifer. It eventually took off and flew north, landing in a large spruce. Next, it flew around the bay and disappeared in Fossetts Cove, where birders reported being able to see it from Pemaquid Seafood. After some time, it reappeared, taking off north up the channel, before returning in dramatic fashion to alight once again across from the fort. Finally, it briefly flew north over the treeline before flying southwest across the peninsula, towards South Bristol. Photos forthcoming.

Heavy overcast. Not much snow. Bit chaotic around the resort with many large cars trying to negotiate the narrow lane with hurriedly parked cars. Got better after a very respectful but firm police officer arrived on scene.	Sitting among the rocks at the north end of Squirrel Island. Massive orange beak obvious as were the large patches of white on leading edge of upper wing. Periodically mobbed by multiple BAEA. Picked up and flew east over Squirrel then across towards Capital Island where it sat in tall conifer, partially obscured. White on wings very useful in terms of picking out the bird and being sure it wasn't a BAEA.  Tail white but head dark, Some 30-40 other observers attracting a local police officer who made us move our cars off the access road. With the very noisy crowd spouting a seemingly random mix of irrelevant and/or outright misinformation so I decided to leave and drive over to the other side of the natural harbor in case I lucked into the bird. Am familiar with the species from Kamchatka (breeding) as well as Japan and Korea (wintering). Awesome to see one in North America, especially such a celebrity individual.

As soon as we arrived at Spruce Point we saw about a dozen birders looking at the STSE perched on a tall tree near the Burnt Island Lighthouse. We observed the STSE for a few minutes and then we saw it fly South to the point and then across the bay towards Squirrel Island. There the Eagle landed on a couple of spots along the shoreline and atop a few trees. We followed the bird for about an hour.

Unfortunately, around 9:10 AM, multiple photographers/ birders approached the eagle closely on foot, directly flushing it (as has happened repeatedly with this individual bird); the sea-eagle flew far to the east, landing again in a tall white pine near Factory Cove, well over a mile away from our position. We shifted over to the Maine State Aquarium but could see the bird only partially in the distance, so we returned to Pine Cliff Rd. again. From this spot, we watched the Steller’s Sea-Eagle soaring high over the eastern side of the harbor with two Common Ravens and a Bald Eagle. The bird soared in view for several minutes before it dipped down in the vicinity of Spruce Point and disappeared; photos/ video

Clear (visibility 10 miles); wind variable at 7 mph to NW at 10 mph, gusting to 22 mph; 1-7º F. Snow cover: the ground is mostly bare, except for scattered patches of ice. West Harbor Pond is completely frozen over, but the water below the bridge in Boothbay Harbor remains open.--We raced over to the Boothbay Harbor Yacht Club, stopped in their parking lot, and ran west across the road, where the sea eagle was quite obvious. A large crowd quickly assembled; unexpectedly, but not really surprisingly, Ann Mitchell was there too (and apparently so was David Bates, although I did not know this at the time, and did not recognize him if I even saw him). For the first few minutes we were content to view from the initial location, but, realizing that a side view might be better (even if a bit more distant), we slipped down to the bridge across the mouth of West Harbor Pond. Only a few other observers were there when we arrived, but many others later joined us, some parking on the side of the road, or even on the bridge. Not surprisingly, this became a traffic issue in short order, and after a couple of hours a few police arrived to try to keep both cars and observers in line. (It was impressive to see, though, how quickly the crowds cleared after the eagle left.) We really wanted to see the bird in flight, but it persisted in giving us absolutely crippling views of it perched, for hour after hour; so periodically we'd take our chances and go sit in the car for a while to warm up (Jay did a good job of parking the car in spots with good visibility of the sea eagle), before heading back out for another stint for forced sea eagle viewing.--Note that this site is just north of the aquarium, across the harbor. We gather that Ross Gallardy and Zach Millen had a quick sighting of this bird early in the morning (from the Southport Swing Bridge?), which they did not post, but which sent them checking the nearby coves on a quest for the eagle. And after a thankfully short search, scanning all close coves and inlets, they came across the bird here. Congrats, and many thanks!--Saturday.

Eastern Standard Time.--Mammals: none observed.	continuing mega rarity. extraordinarily cooperative, almost too much so. when we screamed into the parking lot here and got out of the car, it was perched in full sun in a tall pine on the west side of West Harbor Pond, across from the yacht club, and not 100 yards away. the hefty eagle was facing us, which allowed for great view of the overall bulk, the massive orangey yellow bill, the beady yellow iris, the details of the shaggy brown head and breast plumage, and the white, graduated tail; but we could see only a small piece of the white shoulders (and of only one shoulder to boot). after a while, then, we drifted down to the bridge below, where we could view it from more of an angle, and get a somewhat better appreciation of it. the eagle was quite aware of its surroundings, looking around constantly, but otherwise not doing much: it was big news if it did so much as pull one foot up and tuck it into the plumage. every hour or so it would act as if it might fly: pooping and wiggling the tail; or leaning forward and raising the tail (again pooping?), in each case leading to speculation that it was about to leave. and we all wanted it to fly, we wanted to see the majesty of those broad white shoulders and get a better sense of the overall heft of the bird. despite the apparent flight intention actions, and despite that fact that we were slowly dying in the brutal cold, however, the eagle stubbornly would not take flight. rarely if ever have I waited so long or suffered so much to see a rare bird fly away. after almost four hours, it finally did something dramatic, and turned around on its perch. this presented a possibility that we had not even counted upon: that it might take flight, but instead of flying right past or even over us, it might fly directly away. and that's about what it did: it soon took off, heading away, and would have been lost behind the trees almost immediately had it not angled off to the north and up a bit, so we had a decent, if brief, view of it flight, albeit trending in the wrong direction. just at the end, it turned west again, and we lost it behind trees. ('we' here refers only to Shawn and to me; Jay unfortunately missed this episode, as he had gone back to our Airbnb for an ill-timed bathroom break.) as best that we can determine, it was not seen again for the rest of the day. many photos by Jay, Shawn (but none calendar worthy?), and many others.

Reasoning that we’d have the best odds of spotting it looking north, we went searching for a public vantage point and found Pine Cliff Road. Our instincts turned out to be spot on, and we quickly found the bird on its prominent perch. Several other birders who had the same idea were gathered a little further up the road, leading to much rejoicing and several lovely reunions. Sunny and bright, but still quite breezy and chilly	Incredible record, long awaited chase opportunity after watching the saga develop for months. Finally tracked down after a sunrise sighting of the bird flying south reported from the boat launch between West Boothbay Harbor and Southport. Perched in a tall pine on Juniper Point, scoped looking north from Pine Cliff Road. Massive and imposing raptor, dark brown overall with brilliant white shoulder patches and tail. The immense golden bill was a striking field mark even at a distance. Constantly scanning the harbor, intensity of its glare was palpable whenever it looked our way. A goodly number of birders were able to observe it from this site until a group of observers approached on foot, walking through the intertidal zone right up to the base of its tree. At this point, it took off and headed across Boothbay Harbor, low over the water, coming to roost on the far eastern shore. We subsequently headed back over to the Maine State Aquarium to try our luck from that vantage point, details included in this checklist: https://ebird.org/checklist/S100401072

Unfortunately, around 9:10 AM, multiple photographers/ birders approached the eagle closely on foot, directly flushing it (as has happened repeatedly with this individual bird); the sea-eagle flew far to the east, landing again in a tall white pine near Factory Cove, well over a mile away from our position. We shifted over to the Maine State Aquarium but could see the bird only partially in the distance, so we returned to Pine Cliff Rd. again. From this spot, we watched the Steller’s Sea-Eagle soaring high over the eastern side of the harbor with two Common Ravens and a Bald Eagle.

He then flew along the coast, low to the water, toward Fossett Cove and went into the trees. About 30 minutes later, SSE flew by, disturbing birds in flight and ducks in the water, until roosting in tall pines on Bristol side.	8 ft wingspan, black head, white legs, white blaze on shoulders, orange beak.

A sizable crowd assembled to enjoy the show, including birders from near and far as well as plenty of curious locals. The aerial dogfight between the sea-eagle, a pair of ravens, and a Bald Eagle was truly a spectacle to behold. Well worth the trip! Clear blue skies and bright sun, still cold with light winds	Second encounter of the day with this incredible wandering individual, initial sighting details included in this checklist: https://ebird.org/checklist/S100400825 . After watching the eagle fly east across Boothbay Harbor from its perch on Juniper Point, we drove back to the Maine State Aquarium in the hopes of getting better views. The bird was soon refound perched high in a pine on the far shoreline, mostly obscured by the tree’s branches. The bold white wing markings and heavy golden beak helped pick it out at this distance. Eventually a pair of ravens began harassing it, appearing as small as crows in comparison to the hulking raptor. The eagle soon took off, initially flying west towards us but subsequently turning to head north along the treeline with the corvids in hot pursuit. A Bald Eagle soon joined the circling mob scene, allowing for another amazing direct size comparison with the Steller’s, who appeared a third as big again. Eventually the sea-eagle broke off from its pursuers and continued north, disappearing behind the trees. As far as I know, there were no confirmed reports for the rest of the day

Clear (visibility 10 miles); calm; -2º F. Snow cover: the ground is mostly bare, except for scattered patches of ice.--Despite not having seen the sea eagle fly north up Townsend Gut yesterday evening, we still suspected that it was roosting somewhere to the north, and so decided it was worth a check at dawn. And indeed it was! This morning there were many more observers than yesterday morning, although still perhaps only a dozen or so, and some of these were not quick enough to spot the sea eagle. In hindsight, we have to wonder if yesterday it hadn't flown up the Gut earlier than expected - perhaps even at noon? - which would account for the lack of sightings all afternoon, and the fact that we had missed it here at dusk last night.--Sunday. Civil twilight begins 06:37, sunrise 07:08; sunset 16:28, civil twilight ends 16:59. Eastern Standard Time.--Mammals: none observed.	continuing mega rarity. we were alerted when someone watching from the east end of the bridge called out at ca 07:05 that it was coming,. we snapped to attention, and had a terrific - if all too brief - view as it flew south, fairly low down, over the bridge and farther down the Gut. great views upstream from the bridge, when it was in better light; south of the bridge it was more backlit, and so became more of a silhouette. photographed by Jay, Shawn, and no doubt others.

Clear (visibility 10 miles); wind variable at 7 mph to NW at 10 mph, gusting to 22 mph; 2º-1 F. Snow cover: the ground is mostly bare, except for scattered patches of ice. West Harbor Pond is completely frozen over, but the water below the bridge in Boothbay Harbor remains open.--We raced over to the Boothbay Harbor Yacht Club, stopped in their parking lot, and raced west across the road, where the sea eagle was quite obvious. A large crowd quickly assembled; unexpectedly, but not really surprisingly, Ann Mitchell was there too. For the first few minutes we were content to view from the initial location, but, realizing that a side view might be better (even if slightly more distant), we slipped down to the bridge across the mouth of West Harbor Pond. Only a few other observers were there when we arrived, but many others later joined us, some parking on the side of the road, or even on the bridge. Not surprisingly, this became an issue in short order, and after a couple of hours a few police arrived to try to keep both cars and observers in line. (It ws impressive to see, though, how quickly the crowds cleared after the eagle left.) We really wanted to see the bird in flight, but it persisted in giving us absolutely crippling views of it perched, for hour after hour; so periodically we'd take our chances and go sit in the car for a while to warm up, before heading back out for another stint for forced sea eagle viewing. --Saturday. Civil twilight begins 06:37, sunrise 07:09; sunset 16:26, civil twilight ends 16:58. Eastern Standard Time.--Mammals: none observed.	continuing mega rarity. extraordinarily cooperative, almost too much so. when we screamed into the parking lot here and got out of the car, it was perched in full sun in a tall pine on the west side of West Harbor Pond, across from the yacht club, and not 100 yards away. the massive eagle was facing us, which allowed for great view of the overall bulk, the massive orangey yellow bill, the beady yellow iris, the details of the shaggy brown head and breast plumage, and the white, graduated tail; but could see only a small piece of the white shoulders (and of only one shoulder to boot). after a while, then, we drifted down to the bridge below, where we could view it from more of an angle, and get a somewhat better appreciation of it. the eagle was quite aware of its surroundings, looking around constantly, but otherwise not doing much: it was big news if it do much as pulled one foot up and tucked it into the plumage. every hour or so it would act as if it might fly: pooping and wiggling the tail; or leaning forward and raising the tail (again pooping?), in each case leading to speculation that it was about to fly. and we all wanted it to fly, we wanted to see the majesty of those broad white shoulders and get a better sense of the overall heft of the bird. despite the apparent flight intention actions, and despite that fact that we were slowly dying in the brutal cold, however, the eagle stubbornly would not take flight. rarely if ever have I waited so long or suffered so much to see a rare bird in flight. after almost four hours, it finally did something dramatic, and turned around on its perch. this presented a possibility that we had not even counted upon: that it might take flight, but instead of flying right past or even over us, it might fly directly away. and that's about what it did: it soon took flight, heading away, and would have been lost behind the trees had it not angled off to the north and up a bit, so we had a decent view of it flight, albeit trending in the wrong direction. just at the end, it turned west again, and we lost it behind trees. as best that we can determine, it was not seen again for the rest of the day. many photos by Jay, Shawn (but none calendar worthy?), and many others.

The Steller's was perched about 1/4 mile away high in a hemlock, 10-12 ft from the top, near the shoreline across the bay inlet.  it was facing 45-60 degrees away from our viewpoint, but occasionally turned its head to observe us, giving us a look at its enormous beak. After some 15-20 minutes it took off and flew towards us across the inlet for 5-8 sec before turning further south and heading down the inlet towards the sea.

Super mega-rarity found late yesterday afternoon and alerted to Maine birding community by Nick Lund of Maine Audubon. Many observers on site this morning since daybreak.  I arrived just after 11 am. While walking down to dock along the road a yell rang out, "Flying Left". I watched this massive bird (larger than Bald Eagle) on deep wingbeats cross the skyline about 300 yards offshore, flying from one island to Crow Island. It perched momentarily high in an evergreen treetop where I got one photo before it departed perch apparently reacting to a Bald Eagle fly by.  Large dark bodied bird with obvious large white "shoulder patch" and huge yellow-orange beak. After 30 minutes or so the bird flew from the Crow Island area back across to the original island.  Minutes later it flew toward Mink Island where it apparently perched on the far side, out of sight of the crowd. One photo of bird on perch and one in flight.

Many people were there but  Peter Beckett from Bar Harbor came and got good looks in my spotting scope before flying south along the coastline off of Reid State Park.	Photos large yellow bill brown body and white shoulder patches.  We watched the bird fly south and out of the area over the ocean and across from Reid State Park. By the time I had arrived to Five Island pier the Steller's Sea Eagle had flown out to Mink Island and fortunately was sitting in a tall tree on the eastern side.  Marshall Iliff showed me my first view of this rare bird from Eurasia. I followed up with the best images I could get from this far away. It's large size is the first indication that  this is a large Sea Eagle. They are often referred to as the world’s most magnificent bird of prey, I watched as the bird flew to the small islands off of Reid State Park where it was later found. The large wings seemed to be followed by the outer primary feathers on the upward and downward strokes. The Steller’s sea-eagle is dark brown, impressive when compared to our native Bald Eagle and it is the largest of all sea-eagles.  It also is the heaviest known eagle. Its large size and ability to fly amazing distances. It is a beautiful Eagle to see. We also had comparisons in size to a Common Raven. There were a couple hundred people on and around the pier. For a moment in time, Georgetown was the epicenter of the Maine birding community, the center of the birding worlds gaze and amazement that his bird is here in Maine. I said about two weeks ago that this bird was coming to Maine. We have everything this bird needs to survive. Food and abundance of many pray options.

When Rosie Faunce and I arrived the bird had gone missing for the last 30 min but was apparently believed to be sitting behind Crow Island. We found Todd Day and chatted for just 2-3 min before a call went up that it was flying. I got a quick binoc look and then handed my bins off to Rosie, who was shorter than the crowd and could just see it in windows between heads. Since ID driven her all the way there, I immediately hoisted her up above the crowd height to see the bird and she got on it. Then we had to scurry around the wharf for a second view of it flying S past Malden and Hen Islands and then pulling up to land (obscured) on Mink Island—the southernmost in the Five Islands group. We tried to respot it from the lower wharf area for 10-15 minutes to no avail, connecting with Louis Bevier in the interim. ----While introducing Louis and Todd, some cries flew over the island and Todd noticed them swooping on something which we deduced would likely be the sea-eagle. We could see that whichever eagle it was, was perched just barely out of view so we grabbed the scope and walked up the road a bit, gaining elevation. I stopped at what felt like the right window for a different view and immediately saw it hunkered down low in a notch in the trees. It was not obvious, but the upper third of its body—including its huge bill—could be seen. We got a couple dozen people on it before it shifted perches. It took us a few minutes to realize, but that perch shift seemingly put it in full view from the wharf below, so we scurried back down and Todd quickly spotted it against the skyline of the island in full view. As had happened in Dighton, the bird was surprisingly hard for me to spot, takin a few seconds even in full view in a binocular. The sky was whitish gray behind the bird and I realized that it was because the huge white shoulder patch perfectly broke up the bird’s outline, making it seem like a craggy spruce tip more than the world’s largest eagle. Anyway, these views were excellent and prolonged: we left at 1:30 after 40 minutes of great perched views only to hear it flew S to Reid SB about 10 minutes later. ----Another amazing experience with this bird. Flight photos I have seen confirm the expected: this is the same bird seen in Massachusetts and Atlantic Canada, with the strongly notched p6 and white armpit spots being useful individual identifiers. To my knowledge everyone who wanted to see the bird today (and put in the time it deserved) should have been successful, a welcome change from its recent Massachusetts performance that rewarded only the first responders.

Nice calm water 40 degrees air.	At the dock, the eagle started out at Malden Island at 11:15. We watched as the eagle flew across to Crow Island and called. Here eagles and crows harassed it and it eventually moved to the back center of the island. At this point I got in my kayak and paddled around the north end and saw the bird on the backside. Keeping off shore 40-50 yards the bird was generally not interested in me. I was able to watch the bird for 25 minutes until a pair of Gulls managed to push it from its perch. I followed its path toward Malden Island. I rediscovered the bird in the center of Mink Island with two Bald Eagles. Like the last spot, the bird sat on a high spruce perch and peered at passing birds and into the water. Wonder how much of its own food it gets vs. steals from gulls and Bald Eagles. I paddled back with it still there at 12:45. At about 1:15 after I had loaded up my kayak the bird flew away to the South out toward the tip of the peninsula as I gathered from the shouts and murmurs of the crowd. Ebird allows me to post 10 pictures, so I maxed out being this bird is so rare!

We had to get more looks at this bird after our first 45 minutes we had on private property before being asked to leave. This public location at the wharf was much more ideal for all to attempt to view the bird and the fishermen/lobsterman working on the pier were very tolerant of birders and interested in the bird. One of them looked through my scope for a good 10 minutes at it and took digiscoped photos through it and was in total awe of the bird. Very cool!----Awesome large brown eagle with huge orange bill, white wedge-shaped tail, and white shoulder patches. In flight this bird seemed to have a somewhat sharp upward curve to it's primaries as well as showed clean white leading edge of wing due.

Closer to 100 observers! (most)masked up to catch a view of this feathered wonder-my third attempt but much prefer heading North vs South a few hrs. anyway!!!!!!!!!so well worth the effort; no wind, bleak light conti but mild temps in high 30s/low40s. A festive, gracious group of enthusiasts and this bird definitely took some edge off the bleakness of this year for many! Good end to a challenging year. This majestic wonder was teed up when we arriv., having just arriv itself we were informed, then able to see as it flew across the harbor x2, both directions before moving out of sight before our departure. The bald eagles were definitely escorting it on occasion or more like keeping their eyes on it!! Did not observe too many other birds but this was by choice-of-focus! so am sure there were others to be had! Third attempt and a very sweet one esp. since up in magical Maine vs South of Boston!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	Hesitant to say 'continuing', but! it 'appears' to be the one, the only East coast bird-of-its-kind all have-- been pursuing. Hate to be repetitive but the bill strikes all with its size, color, bold white 'spots'? on the leading wings, bold white tail and lower belly, and massive size and wing span. Pic 'attempts' to follow!!!!!!!!!!!Good endorphin rush to begin a (better) new year!

Focus was clearly on the STELLAR'S SEA EAGLE!	Amazing Asian eagle species that luckily eventually turned up in Maine! This individual was known to have visited New Brunswick, Texas, Massachusetts, and now Maine. Thanks to all who discovered this bird here and to all that helped relocate it on 12/31!----This bird is a huge brown eagle with massive orange bill, white wedge-shaped tail, and white shoulder patches which show on the leading edge of wing in flight.----This location was the location where Matt Gilbert relocated the bird this morning and unfortunately was private property so all 100+ of us were kindly asked to leave. The bird was seen by many from the public Five Islands wharf nearby for several hours following and is where birders should be checking for this bird first down here. PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT LOOKING FOR THE BIRD AT THIS PRIVATE LOCATION!

Photos in flight as it flew south of Griffith's Head.  The bird flew to some small, rocky islands about 1.5 miles southeast of the beach, was harrassed by two bald eagles, and then the sea eagle landed.  It moved around among those small islands and was present until sunset when we had to leave because the gate was closing.   The first image below is a map that shows where the bird was throughout the day on Dec. 31.  ----Description from photos, mostly when the bird was in flight heading south past Griffith's Head: large eagle.  Seen in flight with bald eagles chasing it, providing a means for direct size comparisons.   Steller's was clearly larger with a larger wingspan, slower wing beats, and a longer body.  Brown head; enormous bright yellow beak; extensive white on the leading edges of wings (top and bottom) that was conspicuous in flight.  White tail and white feathers on the upper legs.  Otherwise the body was brown.  When seen perched on rocks about 1.5 miles south of Griffith's Head, with a bald eagle visible in the same field of view, the size differences were obvious.  Even at that distance the dark brown body and head and white patch on the wings were visible, as were the white head and white tail of the bald eagle nearby.

Upon arrival (at about 11:20) I quickly learned that the bird had last been seen retreating to the far side of Crow Island after showing well at various spots during much of the morning. The throng of birders who had gathered on the public pier numbered over 100, and behaved remarkably well. This is an active pier, with lobster boats offloading their catch, as well as pulling traps and loading them onto flatbed trailers. Not once did I hear any frustration among the lobstermen/women or the birders. I was joined by Marshall Iliff and his friend Rosie a few minutes after noon. A handy kayaker paddled to the far side of Crow Island, and not long thereafter, the Sea-Eagle was picked up in flight flying south toward Maiden and Hen Islands, not far off the end of our pier. with at least one nearby Bald Eagle. Initially mobbed by gulls, the two eagles flew in steady, powered flight toward Maiden and Hen, going between them. I moved to the western side of the lobster shack, ready to continue to scope the bird if it emerged. It popped back out at the south end of Hen Island, flying toward Mink Island. I tracked the bird in the scope to where I could no longer see it, but felt confident that I saw the flight change to perch somewhere, out of view. The Bald Eagle continue to fly past Mink Island, but the Sea-Eagle was not with it. Marshall and Rosie rejoined me, and Marshall was also confident that he had a good idea where the bird had perched. He examined the area in my scope, but was unable to find the bird. ----At this point, we were joined by Louis Brevier, my first in-person meeting. While talking, I started to notice crows mobbing a single spot near the skyline of Mink Island. At Marshall's suggestion, we started seeking higher ground, marking the spot on the island by a lone White Pine, and with a change of angle, Marshall was able to find the bird through a small window, perched on the far side of the island. About one-quarter or so of the bird was in view, with its massive, yellow bill showing well. We were able to set up two scopes on this line, and a few dozen folks were able to get this partial view. While watching, we saw the bird do a few perched flaps, and it eventually settled down slope of the island. We also noticed that the plucky kayaker was below this area, aiming a camera not far up. We all headed back down to the lobster shack, and started scoping the skyline again. We found the bird in good silhouette, with a wider window of view, and at this point anyone who was interested in seeing the bird could enjoy scope views for at least thirty minutes. ----This bird was difficult to detect against the skyline. The large white patch on the shoulder breaks up a typical silhouette of a raptor, making my raptor-seeking eye miss the bird. ----Large eagle, much more girth than nearby Bald Eagles. Immense yellow bill. Dark brown overall, with thin pale stripes on the head. Large white shoulder patches seen perched. These patches form a giant white leading edge of the interior two-thirds of the wing in flight. Large, white tail. Truly unmistakable. Nothing notably different about the flight style compared to Bald Eagles; perhaps a bit "heavier."

A dreary, foggy morning by sunrise with some chance of precipitation in the forecast later in the day; however, the weather on the day remained nice enough throughout the morning/early afternoon hours.	Photos.----Originally found and photographed by Linda Tharp on 30 December 2021. Likely the same bird that had appeared on the Taunton River in Massachusetts a couple weeks ago and has been appearing throughout North America (Alaska, Texas, Nova Scotia) over the past year.----Large eagle perched at top of conifer tree on island to the southeast of the wharf parking lot (appears to be Hen Island). Dark body with contrasting white shoulder patches visible while perched, Bird was initially facing away from the parking lot but periodically turned its head to reveal noticeably large orange bill. Immature Bald Eagle perched 20-30 m on adjacent tree top for comparison (Larger than BAEA). Bird took flight and headed north towards Crow Island, perched briefly on top of a visible confider perch, but then moved to the northeast side of the island, limiting visibility from the wharf parking lot. There was a brief vocalization from the Steller's as an adult Bald Eagle flew passed the same island at a relatively close distance followed by the Steller's moving to a different perch on the opposite side of the island. ----The bird remained in this position for 20-25 minutes before taking flight and flying southeast over the water before landing in the trees on one of the islands to the south of the wharf parking lot. The bird remained perch in the trees in this position approximately between 12:30 - 1:30 PM when I departed from the area.

Enormous eagle with huge orange bill, white “shoulder” patches, white tail and huge yellow talons.

Probably 100+ birders present. Initially on the farthest of the four visible Black Rocks, and I was unable to make out any distinctive features in my scope. Thankfully, shortly after I began to view it, it took flight -- and its white-wing patches and tremendous wingspan were evident. It flew to the second-farthest of the rocks, displacing a BAEA that was perched there. When the two interacted, it was clear the Steller's was king. I then watched it for a while as it stayed stationary, its white wing-patches illuminated even on this cloudy, hazy afternoon.----An amazing experience being able to witness this bird for the first time today.

I got to Five Islands at around 7:45, a few dozen birders were milling about on the wharf and seawatching to see if they could spot the bird. Around half an hour later, someone yells, "We got it!" and take of running up the hill from the water. Everyone else grabbed their scopes and ran after him. When someone questioned him about where the bird was sighted from, he responded, "Just get in your car and drive". I got into the car with Nellie and checked my New England Birder's Discord and saw that someone had crossposted the coordinates from the listserv, so we drove about a mile north to the end of Moore's Turnpike. We joined the birders on the shore to see the eagle about half a mile out on Mac Mahan Island, right next to a house on the southern tip. It was incredible even from that far away, the white edge of the wings practically glowed in the morning sun. It eventually flew south to Turnip Island and I got my first good look at the bird through some very kind birders' scopes. The beak and head absurdly proportioned, it looks almost like a cartoon drawing of an eagle. The most striking thing was the eyes, the irises were a cool white. After a while the eagle flew from Turnip Island to the mainland and landed on a tree at the end of Blue Heron lane. The views weren't great, but luckily it decided to fly and land on the southern side of Golf Cove just a couple hundred feet away. Views from the docks were great, it was partially obscured by branches and only half in the sun, but it didn't really matter. Unfortunately, all birders were asked to leave by the property owners at around 9:45 as it was a liability issue. The eagle decided to head out at the same time as the birders, and it wouldn't be long before I got to see it again.

Individual flew closer to Golf Cove as the checklist went on, perching proudly on spruce trees. Birders searching for this eagle should know that the entirety of Moore’s Turnpike is private, and the fishing co-op at the end of the road kindly asked our massive crowd to vacate the premises.

Over the course of the time here, there were probably 250 people, with up to 100-150 at times. Except for the earliest hour or so, I did not carefully record all individuals. Included here are birds encountered scanning the Sheepscot and residential lanes nearby. From 06:50 until about 08:30, I scanned from the end of the public wharf. I then walked to the end of Moore's Turnpike when we got word that the eagle was visible from there. I spent from about 08:45 until 10:30 at this site. I then returned to the public wharf via streets. I also walked to the end of Misty Lane twice, once alone. I was otherwise in the wharf area from 11:00 until 13:50, when I departed for Reid State Park. It was mild for this time of year, and relatively calm. The start was somewhat misty but that cleared before sunrise to partly cloudy skies, which became sunny for mid-morning. The tide was nearing high in the morning, then falling from about 08:30 onward. Temps mid 30s to 40s. [Track erroneous because I did not stop list or edit track]	Amazing luck that this wandering individual was found in Maine after last being seen 20 December along the Taunton River in se. Massachusetts. A local living near the Five Islands wharf had taken photos of the bird and reported this to Nick Lund's blog. Following up, we learned that she, Linda Tharp, had seen the bird on 29 December and then photographed it on 30 December.----A huge eagle that when seen with Bald Eagle appeared one third larger. The bill was especially deep and arched as well as being a rich orangish yellow (both cere and mandibles). Overall a slaty brown with broad white band across upper forewing (lesser and median coverts) and much more narrowly along forewing on underside reaching the wrist. The tail and upper tail coverts were white. The tail was wedge-shaped and sharply tapered to a point; the white on the upper tail coverts encroached on the lower rump (this was noticeable as the bird flew away and quite a distinct difference from Bald Eagle if the white on the wings could not be seen). Another prominent white area was the thighs, flanks, and under tail coverts. With my scope, I was able to see frosted light gray to whitish on the forehead and perhaps some of head. The eye was whitish and rather beady-looking in the big head. The large toes were yellow with black talons.----Characters linking this as the same individual in Massachusetts and before that in Canada were visible in photographs. On the right wing, there is a thin break in the webbing of the inner web on p6. On the right side near the axillars, there is a small white spot. The shape and ragged pattern of the rear border to the white forewing bar also show similar features to flight shots of the bird in Canada.----This morning, Matthew Gilbert and Reed Robinson (and ??) located the bird from a private property vantage north of the wharf (at the end Moore's Turnpike, N 43.83046 W 69.70974). The eagle was perched atop a conifer on the southeast corner of MacMahan Island (perch here N 43.83833 W 69.70564) that was 0.92 kilometers away (over 1/2 mile). With clear and sunny skies, the bird was easily identifiable. The eagle then flew to a perch on Turnip Island, only 0.45 km (a bit over 1/4 mile). We then watched the eagle fly out over the Sheepscot River and at one point seemingly attempt to grab a fish. It was almost as far out as the Bull Ledge buoy (green can) about 1 km away. This is a shallow ledge submerged at high tide, as it was at this time; so perhaps a good spot to find fish. This bird was easily identified at that distance. Gulls harassed the eagle, which eventually flew into trees at the end of Misty Lane and the other side of Gotts Cove (erroneously labeled "Golf Cove" on Google maps). At this point, the bird was 100 to 150 meters away but not easily seen in the trees where it perched. By 10:30, we were asked politely to leave the private property. Returning to the public wharf, we saw the eagle perch on Crow Island (at one point arching its neck and pointing its beak skyward as it called, a strange deep barking sound). We also saw the bird perch at the tops of trees on Malden Island and later Mink Island. At 13:40, the eagle flew south, more or less directly. I followed it as speck in the distance, and we assumed the bird might be off Reid State Park. No sooner had we concluded that when at 13:48 I got a text from Lance Benner that the bird had landed on the islands to the south off Griffith Head. It is possible that we could see the bird as it neared those ledges, which are 7 km (4.37 miles) from the wharf. For a good portion of this flight, I could still make out occasionally the white forewings on the upstroke and/or discern the point of white up the rump.

Thank god this was within striking distance from NYC! After the report came in the evening of the 30th, we knew we had to chase. We left NYC at 4am, arriving on site around 10. Remarkably warm, with light rain and fog the entire drive up, lifting to a low marine layer by the time we arrived, with temps in the high 30's and no wind. Huge numbers of birders, crowding pier while lobstermen we're at work!	Good thing so many people saw this bird, otherwise I wouldn't believe my eyes. Incredible. The stuff of legends. How does this species exist, let alone this individual make it's way to the northeast? massive bill, bulky chest and back, peaked head, bulging secondaries with exceedingly long primaries, and wedge shaped tail giving oscillating impression of power and awkwardness.----Initially relocated this morning from a private road near five islands boat landing, where evicted masses waited for it to emerge. It eventually did so after about 20 minutes of waiting, flying out of Golf Cove, out over Crow Island (flushing a seemingly miniature bald eagle en route), and landing on Malden Island where it sat regally for the next half hour or so, giving staggering views for all. It then flew over to Crow Island where it landed out of view. Liftoff from Malden towards crow especially dramatic, with the massive bird seeming to fly in slow motion through the still air and over still water, with a calling loon setting the soundtrack. We watched this from a rock outcrop exposed by low tide, away from the mob and making for a truly magical experience.

Note: this location is private property and we were asked to leave, so please don't go here.   Description from photos: large eagle.  Seen perched near a bald eagle for a direct size comparison and the Steller's was clearly larger.  Brown head; enormous bright yellow beak; extensive white on the leading edges of wings (top and bottom) that was conspicuous in flight and when perched.  White tail and white feathers on the legs.  Otherwise the body was brown.  Larger wingspan, slower wing beats, and longer body than the bald eagle seen harrassing it.  Vocalizations heard briefly and clearly different from the bald eagle, which also vocalized.  Immature bald eagle also seen in the area when the sea eagle was visible. White on the undersides of immature bald eagle wings was patchy, tail was not uniformely white, and there were no white "pantaloon" feathers along the upper legs.----The final sequence of six images shows a bald eagle approach and then buzz the sea eagle.  The sea eagle vocalized when this happened.  The sequence lasts 9 seconds.

First spotted this incredibly majestic bird flying directly towards the large crowd of observers before it landed on the top of a pine in perfect sunlit lighting on Turnip Island to the north. Bird posed for pictures there for a while before it flew out over the bay, low and magnificently, where its enormous size was blatantly apparent. It occasionally slowed and hovered briefly over the water, suggesting hunting behavior? Then it flew south to a tree just south of Golf Cove (once again at the tip top, where it seems to like perching). Here it was harassed by a Bald Eagle until it flew directly towards the group of probably a hundred birders, landing in a pine along Golf Cove merely a hundred or so feet away, much to the oohs and ahhs of the crowd. ----At this point we were asked to leave the property, but as I understand it, it was later seen from the public Five Islands Wharf just to the south. Absolutely remarkable bird, in both size (that beak!!) and habits, and I couldn't think of a better way to finish out 2021, especially after the pain of missing the opportunity to chase it back in Massachusetts the week prior.

Saw the dark body and large white wing patches. Got our best look when it flew from the island on the left to a longer island behind an island to our right (landing on the left side of a prominence on that distant island).  As it flew we got good views of the dark body contrasting with the white leading edge on the wings and the long white tail. Plus an adult bald eagle was in the air near it at the same time, making the massive size difference clear.

Between Moore's Turnpike and Five Islands, the bird moved to and from at least eight different perches while I was present, sitting in one spot for extended periods of time and occasionally disappearing on the back side of an island for a while. It took off just as I was leaving and flew south to Reid SP, where it was still being seen at the time of this writing (3:50 p.m.).----This was an absolutely enormous eagle, easily exceeding the size of the numerous Bald Eagles that were usually nearby and occasionally harassing the Steller's. --The MASSIVE bright yellow bill was very easily seen at most times and positively glowed in the sunlight. When perched, a large and conspicuous white slash was prominent on each wing and the bird had the appearance of wearing a pair of fluffy white "pants". The tail was white (perhaps a bit dingy) and the body plumage was a very dark brown with some golden streaking down the nape. A pale whitish eye was occasionally visible.----In flight the Steller's had a different profile than a Bald Eagle, looking bulkier but somehow also lankier with more planklike wings and a more protruding and sagging head and neck (no doubt this appearance was at least partially due to the massive bill, but the neck did appear longer and the head smaller in proportion to the body). The white in the wings appearing as a large slash when perched proved to be the marginal and maybe lesser(?) coverts and perhaps into the alula and primary coverts, covering the entire leading edge of the wing (except the primaries) with white on both the upper and lower surfaces, but being more extensive in the upper.----The bird called on one occasion upon alighting atop a conifer on Crow Island. It gave a series of repetitive, low barking notes with a somewhat hoarse sound to it, unlike the clear-toned calls that observers in Massachusetts recorded on 12-20-21.----[notes written from my memory of watching this bird through my scope]----Photos shortly

So happy it reappeared after its time in MA and well worth the drive!	It had just flown to the back of Crow Island when we arrived. We waited for 30-40 minutes then a couple of BAEA flushed it out. Stunning to see in flight and how the BAEA paled in size comparison. It flew to the far side of Hen Island where it disappeared from view for probably another 15 minutes then perched beautifully atop trees. Incredible, enormous beak and striking white on upper wings.

Located by another party just north of lobster pound.  M.ob. moved quickly to Moore's Turnpike (private), where bird was seen well perching on the tops of conifers on MacMahan and possibly Turnip Islands.  Nice views for 20 minutes before it flew to the south.  The white tail was visible when it flew and landed.  Very large eagle with a huge orangish-yellow bill and orangish-yellow feet.  White on wing coverts was extremely prominent ventrally and dorsally against the overall very dark plumage.  White on legs was also visible.  I was surprised that the white forehead illustrated in some guides was very difficult to see.  Grayish streaks on the fore neck were also visible.  Eye color was a shade darker than on a BAEG.  I was not overwhelmed by the bird's size so wonder if it is likely a male.  Although I had no direct comparison, it looked pretty close to the size of a large female BAEA.

Lance Benner sent a message that it had flown in down here and landed on the distant, southernmost visible islets, which I think are known as The Sisters. If so, those are 4.5 km away. The bird was beyond the nearer, larger islets "only" 2.37 km away. It was a pleasant late afternoon with gorgeous sunset. I showed several people the bird through my scope, set up alongside Doug Hitchcox and his scope. Geoff LeBaron and his wife Heidi got looks and stayed with us. Jeff Cherry was near us too. But I started by walking up to the high point at Griffith Head to talk to Lance Benner. Michael Good was there, and I remember Glenn and Anna Hodgkins arriving. There were many people, and I forget all who were there. I would guess up to one hundred people were there to see the eagle. I did not go much beyond the headland and spent most of my time at the trail intersection out toward the dunes and beach.	Adult that came down here from Five Islands and perched on islets off Griffith Head. The bird jousted with a Bald Eagle at times and can be seen in distant images as clearly larger than that species. When it flew, the white leading edge to the wing was clear. At rest, one could see the entire shoulder was white. I am not sure I ever certainly saw the bill color at this distance and in the fading light.

I am not familiar with the area, but kept checking for updates when someone had posted the exact location. At this moment I was 36 minutes out but drove like a bat out of hell and made it in 26! After parking and walking in to the location someone kindly pointed to the tree it was perched in. I managed to get a few photos in the glaring sun before we were asked to leave the cove (apparently it was private property) so I was only there for about 5 minutes. The massive eagle looked around a bit, and did not seemed bothered by the crowd or the bald eagle that flew by.

Refound this morning, first spotted by Matthew Gilbert as Reed and Chris were stumbling out of the car. Massive eagle with deep yellow bill, white scapulars, and white tail. Individual flew closer to Golf Cove as the checklist went on, perching proudly on spruce trees. Birders searching for this eagle should know that the entirety of Moore’s Turnpike is private, and the fishing co-op at the end of the road kindly asked our massive crowd to vacate the premises. The best public location to view this bird remains at Five Islands Wharf (43.8238114, -69.7093513). Many thanks to Linda Tharp, who first reported the bird yesterday, and Nick Lund and Maine Audubon for getting the word out. An amazing bird to end the year!

Word got out that it had been sighted from Reid State Park, so headed over there with many others.	Viewed at great distance with scope. It was on a rock ledge next to a Bald Eagle, then it flew to another rock ledge, had a brief aggressive encounter with another Bald Eagle, and then stayed perched on rock ledge until I left. Even at that distance it was obviously bigger than the Bald Eagle next to it. The white wing patches were visible when it flew and also perched.

I got Five Islands at around 7:45, a few dozen birders were milling about on the wharf and seawatching to see if they could spot the bird. Around half an hour later, someone yells, "We got it!" and take of running up the hill from the water. Everyone else grabbed their scopes and ran after him. When someone questioned him about where the bird was sighted from, he responded, "Just get in your car and drive". I got into the car with Nellie and checked my New England Birder's Discord and saw that someone had crossposted the coordinates from the listserv, so we drove about a mile north to the end of Moore's Turnpike. We joined the birders on the shore to see the eagle about half a mile out on Mac Mahan Island, right next to a house on the southern tip. It was incredible even from that far away, the white edge of the wings practically glowed in the morning sun. It eventually flew south to Turnip Island and I got my first good look at the bird through some very kind birders' scopes. The beak and head absurdly proportioned, it looks almost like a cartoon drawing of an eagle. The most striking thing was the eyes, the irises were a cool white. After a while the eagle flew from Turnip Island to the mainland and landed on a tree at the end of Blue Heron lane. The views weren't great, but luckily it decided to fly and land on the southern side of Golf Cove just a couple hundred feet away. Views from the docks were great, it was partially obscured by branches and only half in the sun, but it didn't really matter. Unfortunately, all birders were asked to leave by the property owners at around 9:45 as it was a liability issue. The eagle decided to head out at the same time as the birders, and it wouldn't be long before I got to see it again.

We were lucky enough to see it through a scope on the island to our left as we looked out to sea. Saw the dark body and large white wing patches. Got our best look when it flew from the island on the left to a longer island behind an island to our right (landing on the left side of a prominence on that distant island).  As it flew we got good views of the dark body contrasting with the white leading edge on the wings and the long white tail. Plus an adult bald eagle was in the air near it at the same time, making the massive size difference clear.

Seen from Five Islands Lobster. Perched on top of tree on small island (approximately 43.826103, -69.705256). Large eagle with brown body and head, with distinct white shoulder patches. Huge, bright orange bill. White tail seen when it took flight. Too distant for anything but record shots with my camera, and unfortunately none with orange bill. Many thanks to the other birders sharing scope views. ----I missed this closer to home, and had spent most of my holiday break checking the Mass Rare Bird Alerts thread, much to the annoyance of my wife. However, on the morning of the 31st, when I told her it was still being seen, she suggested I go. Many thanks to her for tolerating my day long-absence. I got a late start leaving Cambridge--a few minutes before 11AM. About 30 minutes into my drive I saw a message pop up that the eagle had flown, I considered the alternative of spending the day on Plum Island instead, but decided I would rather drive to Maine and miss the bird than cancel and miss the bird. With light traffic and only moderate speeding (which may have turned out to be crucial for the satisfying looks I got at Five Islands), I made it in a bit over 2.5 hours. I parked in one of the first spots I found about 0.2 miles down the road from the wharf, got my things together, and jogged down to the dock, arriving at about 1:30 PM. My timing was perfect, other birders graciously shared scope views. The bird flew at 1:38.

When we first got here, no one was on the bird because of the fog. After about 10 mins, I spotted it flying over the water and alerted the 200+ people that I have eyes on it. Shortly after, it perched on Wood Island directly across from Grey Haven Inn. Good scope views. Amazing looks at it, they yellow beak and the white wing patches were evident. What a stressful 2 and a half hour drive from my hometown in mass. So worth it! Digi-scope photos will be added

If a stakeout hotspot is created for the eagle viewing from the Inn, will merge checklist location accordingly.	after completely dismal views this morning through the thick fog at ~2 miles viewing distance, we watched the Steller's sitting atop one of the conifers on the island across from the Inn before it relocated to a large rock much farther south for awhile, likely to position itself closer to an actively hunting Bald Eagle. Immediately after the Bald Eagle caught a sizable fish, the Steller's Sea-Eagle lifted off the rock at 1421 hours in hot pursuit of the Bald Eagle, chasing it toward us along the coast before both flew directly over our position at the Inn before peeling off to the west and out of view, much to the elation of the large crowd. Incredible and unforgettable experience. Photos

Spent the first two hours scoping from the end of the pier. The bird was spotted around 8:30 am on small island (to the left of Crow Island). It was only visible for a few minutes, from the far corner of the pier until it flew out of sight. Within a few minutes, the bird was spotted perching on a tree on Crow Island where it stayed for quiet some time, giving great views. The bird made its way gradually down the coast, stopping to perch on each of the small islands for varying amounts of time. The massive eagle appeared mostly black with bold white patches on the wings, white tail and “bloomers” and a comically large orange bill. Watching this bird fly through the fog and rain was a surreal experience. Couldn’t think of a better way to welcome in 2022 with this stunningly beautiful bird!

Word got out to birdiing community late on December 30. Hundreds of birders saw this vagrant on December 31. The bird was less cooperative today and many of the dozens of people there did not get to see it.----Seen first perched in tree on point of land adjacent to Wood Island. White shoulders, massive orange bill, and white feathers on legs were all conspicuous. The bird left its perch to harass a Bald Eagle. The white leadiing edge of the wings and the tapered white tail were evident.

The bold white shoulder patch and large bill were barely visible at 60-power.  Luckily, it flew south towards us and landed in a tree on what Google Maps has labeled as Crow Island.  After perching there for a while, it flew right past us heading south at around 9:30 and landed on Malden Island for another period of time.  A stellar way to start off the new year!  Puts watching a ball drop to shame.

Viewing conditions were not optimal even with spotting scope. A large blackish bird with prominent white shoulders. Other field markings (head, bill, tail and "leggings") were not clearly visible due to lighting and bird positioning. Toward end of observation period thick fog moved in obscuring view of eagle which then flew up Harmon Harbor but was missed by these observers and very quickly went out of sight behind trees. Other birders speculated it may have gone to Charles Pond or even returned to the Five Islands area.

The sea-eagle was all the way across the Sheepscot River (over 2 km away) standing alone on a bare rock in the water south of Pratt's Island. A very large, dark eagle, it was clearly visible, but not necessarily identifiable, through binoculars. Through another birder's scope, the diagnostic diagonal white patch on the wing was clearly visible.

Birding with Larry Haugh. No sightings of the Steller’s Sea Eagle at this location. Thank you to the owners of the Gray Havens Inn for allowing a large group of birders access to their property! Great views of the Steller’s Sea Eagle that was perched on top of a tree at the south end of Wood Island located in the Sheepscot River Harmon Harbor.	The Steller’s Sea Eagle was perched for more than an hour on top of a tree near the south end of Wood Island. Is was foggy most of the time and around 3:15 pm the eagle flew as the island was enveloped by dense fog.  A few people did see the Eagle fly north upstream of the Sheepscot River. Large Eagle with heavy yellow beak, white tail and white shoulders.

Someone alerted the group that they had the bird in their scope, but it was distant and only visible from one vantage point on the pier. Not too longer after, the bird flew out of sight and the crowd started to work their way off the pier to give the working fishermen room. I walked up onto a rock on the edge of the parking lot and started scanning the islands again and quickly caught a flash of white at the top of a conifer on Crow Island: the Steller's Sea-Eagle! What a distinctive bird, hard to mistake it when compared to any other expected species in this area. In the lighting, the bird appeared mostly black with clean white patches on the wings, white "pants" and a ridiculously large orange bill. White tail seen in flight. The bird was absolutely stunning in flight. Awesome experience, despite the fog and rain.

Ran into BR at parking lot of Kennebunk Service Plaza……. Parked a two-minute walk up the road from Five Islands pier because we heard the town lot was filling up. As we rounded the bend and could finally see down and out toward the islands the bird flew from the left of the dock (north) heading to the right of the dock (south). Still approaching, I said to the group, “Is that the eagle??” And someone said “yes it is! Look now!” so I dropped my mittens and tripod and watched it land tail-down in a treetop on one of the southern islands through my binoculars. What a greeting!! All of us were absolutely stunned by this bird. It continued to hang about for awhile and eventually flew to the next small island, furthest to the right, where it displaced a BAEA and perched up again and was visible as just a white wing patch and yellow bill in the fog. We stayed until it flew out around the back of this small island, looping around the left side until it was out of view. We hung around until the rain really picked up. Photographers returning from the lobster boat reported it was still perched up on the back side of the small island as we were leaving. Came away with a variety of supremely mediocre cell phone photos through scope/nocs and with enormous smiles. What an extraordinary start to the new year. :)

I was told that the eagle had been perched near the top of the same tree on Wood Island for the previous 3 ½ hours.  Another birder told me that the Steller’s Sea-Eagle flew over my head chasing a Bald Eagle that had a fish. If I had only thought to look upward, I would have seen it!  That was the frustrating beginning to what was eventually a wonderful and exhilarating experience.  The one hundred or so birders that were at Grey Havens Inn gradually departed.  Several birders suggested that I remain at Grey Havens Inn, since their best guess is that the eagle could return to Wood Island since it had spent so much of the day there. For the first few minutes, I was alone looking for the eagle.  Then other birders gradually trickled in.  After about 30 minutes of waiting, one birder called out “I think I might see a Bald Eagle”. Disappointed, but hoping that perhaps the bird was not a Bald Eagle but a Steller’s Sea-Eagle, I quickly got my binoculars on the bird.  Extensive white shoulders, large white wedge-shaped tail, white leg feathers, with a fish in its massive orange bill.  I yelled out “it’s the Steller’s Sea-Eagle”.  An enormous relief followed by unbridled joy.  The Steller’s Sea-Eagle landed in the top of a tree on the mainland, perhaps 100 or 200m north of the tree at which it had spent the previous few hours before I arrived. The number of birders present continued to increase, perhaps reaching about 100 people, and each person quickly got onto the bird. It was wonderful to see so many happy, smiling birders.  The Steller’s Sea-Eagle remained atop the same tree, sometimes preening, looking around, appearing a little restless, as if it was about to leave. After about 30 minutes, the Steller’s Sea-Eagle left the tree flying to the northwest and then out of sight.  A truly amazing and incredible experience. Certainly, one of the most thrilling and memorable birds I have ever seen.

This bird is so unbelievable it deserves the full story. I knew about this bird’s North American wanderings for some time, but it seemed too distant or fleeting to pursue. But yesterday when I saw that it was continuing to hang out here, with wide open flights and cheap rental cars, I decided to make the trip. This morning I saw word that it had been refound in the same area as before, off Five Islands. I boarded my flight and hoped it would stick, hoping that the poor weather would keep it down. I arrived and booked it up 295. When I got to Five Islands the wharf was packed. At least 50 birders in line for the lobsterman’s boat trips to Mink Island, where the bird was apparently staked out, out of sight from land, and just as many lined up scoping the distant island. With not enough daylight left to wait in the line, I resigned myself to waiting for a distant look if the bird ever took off from its hiding place. As the boat set out again below us, the crowd noticed that it didn’t round the tip of the distant island like before, but instead hugged the shoreline. I began to realize that the bird had flown and somehow escaped our notice! Right then I got a text that there were good views from the inn, and sped over. When I arrived the eagle was perched in a spruce at the far southern end of Wood Island, across the harbor from the inn. Scope views revealed the massive orange-yellow bill, and chocolate brown color, and white tail. The bird remained perched for nearly an hour, occasionally moving a bit, and revealing white shoulder patches. I resolved to just stand in the rain and fog and wait for it to fly. It briefly vocalized twice—a raspy, gull-like call, not at all like its congener, Bald Eagle. After nearly an hour I was chatting with other birders when I heard a commotion, and looked up to see a huge bird flying toward us. At first I thought it was a heron. Then I got bins on it and realized it was the eagle! It flew past us at about 50 yards. It was an absolute behemoth. It flew effortlessly and boldly. Completely regal and a bird that is clearly used to being the ruler of its domain. As it flew it was harassed by crows. And just like that, it was gone. An unbelievable experience. Abysmal but diagnostic pics pending.

Guided by Doug Suitor.  Met Ashlee and Ryan Duff  and Tom Danielson there.	Present for fourth day.  Arrived at Five Islands Wharf to start the day. Tide almost full high.  The eagle was first spotted from another location and most of the birders departed to look for it.  Tom D. spotted it from the wharf and we watched from this location for about 1/2 hour before we decided to drive around to a closer location.   It apparently flew across the river and out of sight as we were leaving.  Very large dark eagle with bold white patches on upper shoulders and an impressive orangey yellow bill.  White on legs and tail obscured by the tree branches.  Not an intimate look but satisfying considering the unlikelihood of the birds presence in Maine.

Then the bird picked up and flew right toward us, landing atop a spruce on the north end of Wood Island. It was in a much more favorable position than when viewed from here yesterday. Its massive orange beak showed boldly, as did its white shoulder patches. This time, the bird was facing us. It was also much more active than yesterday, moving frequently and preening. It even briefly did that raptor “neck thing” where it moves it’s head side to side. Very lucky to have seen it at all, much less two days in a row.

Left work on New Years day at 1030pm.  7 hours of driving and a caffeine pill later I arrived on no sleep (attempted to, but not successful).  We staked out the docks, but around 830am got the message the bird was being seen on nearby Wood Island.  Luckily was one of the prime spots for parking which made for an easy escape and was one of the first to arrive at the Grey Havens Inn (gracious owners were allowing birders to utilize their place for viewing).  Bird was perched atop trees a few hundred yards out into the river.  Shifted once to the opposite end of the island, eventually taking off North and across the channel.  With already so much time committed to this trip, I made the call to head home getting back at 430pm.  14 hours of driving, 2 hours of birding, and 1 spectacular bird!	Spectacular.  Re-found by other birders on Wood Island while the majority of us were at the docks.  Mad chase to get out and get to the spot.  Observed the bird for approximately 30 minutes before it took off across the river.  Believe it is estimated that approximately 4000 birds remain, most on the kamchatka peninsula in Russia.  Size was deceiving until the bird took flight, and when it did, man was it impressive.  Bird averages about 50% heavier than our Bald Eagle which was very evident during flight with an almost pot belly appearance.  Striking white markings with a very large, bright yellow beak.  This was a memorable chase that I will not soon forget.

Epic looks from the Town lobster docks!  Perched prominently, and quite regally, on Crow, Malden, Hen, and Mink Islands.  Eventually disappearing behind Mink, but not before our group viewed the bird for well over an hour.  Truly amazing looks, especially while in flight.  A MOB'd, and well documented, bird first reported to the Maine-Birds (Google) Group by Linda Tharp via Nick Lund on the 30th.  This chocolatey brown bird with its massively exaggerated hooked orange bill, large white "shoulders," and long (almost Booby-like) white wedge-shaped tail has been burned indelibly into the mind.

Viewing conditions were not optimal even with spotting scope. A large blackish bird with prominent white shoulders. Other field markings (head, bill, tail and "leggings") were not clearly visible due to lighting and bird positioning. Toward end of observation period thick fog moved in obscuring view of eagle which then flew up Harmon Harbor but was missed by these observers and very quickly went out of sight behind trees. Other birders speculated it may have gone to Charles Pond or even returned to the Five Islands area.

A magnificent looking bird well worth the 7-hour drive.	MEGA rarity, reported at this location on 12/30 by Linda Tharp. More recently the eagle was seen in Massachusetts as well as other locations from Alaska to Texas to eastern Canada. So very glad we made the trip despite the fog and overcast skies.

Spent roughly first two hours scoping from the end of the pier. The bird was spotted around 8:30/9 am on small island (to the left of Crow Island). It was only visible for a few minutes, from the far corner of the pier until it flew out of sight. Within a few minutes, the bird was spotted perching on a tree on Crow Island where it stayed for quiet some time, giving great views. The bird made its way gradually down the coast, stopping to perch on each of the small islands for varying amounts of time. The massive eagle appeared mostly black with bold white patches on the wings, white tail and “bloomers” and a comically large orange bill. Watching this bird fly through the fog and rain was a surreal experience. Couldn’t think of a better way to welcome in 2022 with this stunningly beautiful bird!

Later flew to a closer island and perched in a conifer where it was mobbed by a AMCR. Approximately 20 minutes later it flew closer still, now slightly right of the wharf. It perched in another conifer for about 20 minutes before flying to the next small island on the right. We left it perched, still visible but more obscured at this point. Enormous and very distinctive black and white raptor with white wing patches, white wedge-shaped tail, and comically large orange-yellow bill.
